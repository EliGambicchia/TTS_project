[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Grease a large 25cm by 35cm roasting tray with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork. </li><li>Layer the filo sheets into the tray, laying one sheet horizontally, and the next vertically, repeating as you layer, brushing a little of the egg between each sheet. (Make sure they cover the base of the tray and go up the sides so it can contain the filling.) Add a final brush to the last layer and scrunch up any excess pastry that hangs over. </li><li>Finely slice the spring onions and add to the bowl. Coarsely grate the Cheddar cheese (reserving a little for the top) and the courgette, then add them to the bowl. Break the broccoli into florets, then thinly slice and add to the bowl. Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, then mix together.</li><li>Carefully pour the mixture into the prepared pastry case, spreading it out so it’s in an even layer, then sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.</li><li>Cook for 35 minutes, on the bottom of the oven, until the pastry is golden and the filling is set.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place the flour in a large dough with a good pinch of sea salt. Pour 325ml of tepid water into a jug. Add the yeast and mix with a fork for a couple of minutes, until dissolved. Add a pinch of the flour and mix well, then pour the yeast mixture into the bowl. Use a fork to mix it all together until you can’t move it anymore – this will stop the dough sticking to your hands.</li><li>Now get your clean hands in there and bring it together as a ball of dough, kneading and moving it around the bowl until the dough comes away from the sides.</li><li>Transfer the dough to a flour-dusted surface and keep it moving, kneading, pushing and stretching it for 5 minutes, or until you have a silky and elastic dough.</li><li>Use your floured hands to shape the dough into a rough ball, put it in an oiled bowl, and cover with a clean, damp tea towel. Allow it to prove for about an hour, or until doubled in size – ideally in a warm, draught-free place.</li><li>Meanwhile, drizzle 1 tablespoon each of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar into a large bowl. Tear in the basil leaves, then halve the tomatoes and finely slice the courgette, adding them to the bowl as you go. Squash, destone and tear over the flesh of the olives and toss everything together gently with your hands. </li><li>Once the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out by punching it with your fist, then knead on a flour-dusted surface for 30 seconds, or until smooth. </li><li>Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to about the size of a tea towel, then rub the red pesto all over the dough using your hands, spreading it out to the edges. Scatter over the courgette mix evenly and tear over the mozzarella. </li><li>Roll up the dough lengthways, like a Swiss roll, wrapping all the lovely fillings inside, then with a sharp knife, cut into twelve chunks. Place the pieces close together, swirl-side up, in an ovenproof pan (about 26cm) or on a snug, oiled baking tray, then cover with a clean tea towel. Leave to prove again for 30 minutes to an hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 190ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Bake on the bottom of the oven for about 35 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Turn the loaf out onto a board and allow to cool slightly before serving. Delicious!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Put the tea bags into a jug, cover with 150ml of boiling water and leave to steep for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, destone the dates and put into a food processor with the cinnamon and ginger, then finely grate in half the nutmeg. Scoop out the tea bags and pour the tea over the dates, pushing them down so they’re submerged. Leave them to soak with the lid on for 10 minutes. Add the roasted pumpkin or squash, then blitz to a purée, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides, which will help it along.</li><li>Butter and lightly flour a 26cm Bundt tin or a 20cm x 30cm baking dish. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugars together using a wooden spoon. Beat in the eggs, one by one then, using a large metal spoon, stir in the flour and fold in the puréed dates. Pour the pudding mixture into your chosen receptacle, then bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until an inserted skewer comes out clean.</li><li>When your pudding is almost ready, make the sauce. Cube the butter and melt in a small pan on a medium heat. Add both the sugars, then, once nicely mixed, carefully add the rum (it may splatter) and double cream. Bring to the boil, then simmer for around 5 minutes, or until a lovely deep golden colour.</li><li>As soon as the pudding is out of the oven, if using a Bundt tin, flip out onto a platter and brush all over with enough sauce to form a delicate, crispy surface but also keep your sponge nice and bouncy. Or, if you’re traybaking it in a dish, poke small holes in the top and pour over one-third of the sauce. Sprinkle with a little sea salt for contrast, and serve with the remaining sauce on the side (or save for another day) and a little double cream, Greek yoghurt, ice cream or custard, if you like.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Start with the marinade. Peel the garlic, and finely grate into a large bowl with the zest of 1 lemon. Cut the peaches into quarters, removing the stones, and finely grate just one quarter into the mix. Add all the remaining peach quarters, squeeze in most of the lemon juice (save a little for later), add 4 tablespoons of oil and the oregano. Season with black pepper, and lightly toss together.</li><li>Score both sides of each block of halloumi in a criss-cross fashion, going about ½ a centimetre deep, then cut each into 6 chunks and add to the peaches.</li><li>Cut the bread into chunks about the same size as the halloumi, add to the bowl and toss it all together.</li><li>Take a bit of pride in skewering everything up onto 4 long skewers, then cook on the barbecue, or in a griddle pan, until golden and beautifully charred. Move to a serving platter.</li><li>Tear off the top leafy half of the parsley and dress with the remaining lemon juice, a little oil and a pinch of salt, then scatter over the skewers. Crush the pistachios in a pestle and mortar and sprinkle over the top, then drizzle with the honey to finish.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place the pineapple rings (reserving the juice) in a large dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. </li><li>Cut the tofu into four chunks and add to the pan. Let it all gently char for 4 minutes, then turn, char on the other side and remove, leaving the pan on the heat. </li><li>Deseed the peppers, chop into 2cm chunks and place in the pan with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil, then reduce to a medium-low heat. Trim the spring onions, chop the white halves into 2cm lengths and add to the pan, reserving the green tops. Peel, finely slice and add the garlic, then cook it all for 10 minutes, or until soft and charred, stirring regularly. </li><li>Meanwhile, finely slice the green halves of the spring onions. In a heatproof bowl, cover the noodles with boiling kettle water. In a pestle and mortar, pound the wasabi peas until fine.</li><li>Mix the miso paste into the reserved pineapple juice, then pour into the pepper pan with a splash of water. Let it sizzle for a minute, then return the tofu and pineapple to the pan to glaze. </li><li>Drain the noodles, divide between your plates and spoon over the sticky miso peppers, followed by the tofu and pineapple. Sprinkle with the sliced green spring onion and crushed wasabi peas, then tuck right in.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Slice 3 aubergines into 2cm-thick rounds. In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon each of olive oil and red wine vinegar, 1 heaped teaspoon of massaman paste and a small pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then brush on both sides of the sliced aubergines. Arrange in a single layer in a large roasting tray and roast for 40 minutes. </li><li>Meanwhile, blacken the remaining 3 aubergines in a deep non-stick frying pan on a high heat, turning until charred and tender, then remove, leaving the pan on the heat. While they blacken, crush the cashews in a pestle and mortar, then put aside. </li><li>Trim the spring onions, chop the white halves (reserving the greens) and place in the pestle and mortar with the remaining massaman paste. Peel, chop and add the ginger, then pound into a paste. Finely slice the green spring onions lengthways and put into a bowl of cold water to curl up.</li><li>Halve the charred aubergines and scoop the insides into the hot pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, discarding the skins. Stir in the paste for 2 minutes, then pour in the coconut milk, stock and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, and bring to the boil. </li><li>Alongside, cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and divide between warm bowls. Season the soup to perfection and ladle over the noodles, then top with the roasted aubergine slices. </li><li>Drain the curly spring onions and toss in a little red wine vinegar, then scatter over with the crushed cashews.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Pour the flour into a bowl, make a well in the middle, then add the yoghurt. Use your clean hands to mix it together, until you have a dough.</li><li>Wash and dry your hands, then dust your work surface and hands with flour. Split the dough into 2 equal pieces. Stretch the dough with your hands or roll it out with a rolling pin to about ½ a centimetre thick.</li><li>Put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat – make sure you’ve got an adult around.</li><li>Once the pan is hot, carefully add the dough to the dry pan and cook for 2 or 3 minutes, or until golden and puffed up. Use tongs to turn the flatbreads over, and cook for the same time on the other side. </li><li>Remove the flatbreads from the pan and spread a little knob of butter on top, moving it about with the back of a spoon until it’s melted. You can have your flatbreads simply with honey or jam, you can top them with eggs, or serve them with a curry. You can do anything with them!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. Grease a couple of large baking trays with oil. </li><li>Tip the yoghurt into a large mixing bowl with the flours, bicarbonate of soda, honey, 1 egg and a large pinch of sea salt. </li><li>Stir with a fork until everything just comes together, then get in there with your hands and shape the dough into a ball. </li><li>Dust a clean surface with flour and flatten the dough into a large disc, roughly 2.5cm thick.</li><li>Stamp out 24 rounds with a 5cm crinkle cutter, dipping the cutter in flour if the dough starts to stick, placing them on the oiled trays as you go. </li><li>Beat the remaining egg and use it to eggwash the scones, then sprinkle over the oats. Bake in the centre of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until puffed up and golden.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Cut or slice up the veg into fine or chunky pieces, depending on what you’re looking for. I quite like purposely cutting each veg differently – some diced, some into erratic chunks, some sliced delicately and some more thickly.</li><li>Place all the veg in a sterilised airtight jar, add 125ml of water, along with the vinegar, salt, sugar and herbs and spices, if using. Close the lid and give it a good shake.</li><li>Keep in the fridge for up to 8 weeks, or you can absolutely use it right away – it will start off tasting quite sharp and crunchy, then relax into itself over a period of a few weeks. This pickle is brilliant in sandwiches and salads, on a cheese board, or as a side to curries and stir-fries.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Mix the flour and honey in a large bowl, then stir in the sourdough starter to combine – the dough will be quite stiff, add 1 teaspoon of water to help bring it together, if needed. </li><li>Wrap the dough in a clean damp tea towel and leave to rest for 20 minutes.</li><li>Preheat your oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. </li><li>Divide the dough into two and work with one piece at a time, keeping the other piece covered. Roll out the dough as thinly as you can, around 2mm thick. You can either cut the dough into shapes, or keep it whole (as long as it fits on your tray).</li><li>Place the dough on the lined tray and gently brush or spray with a little water. Sprinkle with a little sea salt, and with sesame, fennel or caraway seeds, or a mixture, if you like. Repeat with the other half of the dough. </li><li>Bake the crackers for 5 minutes, then flip them over and bake for another 8 to 10 minutes, or until crisp and brown all over. </li><li>Remove and cool on a wire rack, then tuck on in. Delicious with cheese and chutney or fresh fruit like grapes or figs. Store any leftovers in an airtight container.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Fill the cup with the flour and tip into a large bowl. Fill the same cup with milk and pour that into the bowl too, then crack in the egg. Whisk everything together until it’s nice and smooth.</li><li>Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Once hot, add a small knob of butter then, once the butter has melted and starts to sizzle, add large spoonfuls of batter to the pan – you’ll need to cook your pancakes in batches.</li><li>Wait for little bubbles to form on the surface of the pancakes, about 1 to 2 minutes, then use a fish slice to flip them over to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes on the other side, or until golden again.</li><li>Carefully wipe out the pan with a ball of kitchen paper, then add another small knob of butter and cook the next batch. </li><li>Serve the pancakes right away with your favourite toppings – I like a bit of fruit and a drizzle of honey.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Put the flour and 1 teaspoon of sea salt into a large bowl and make a well in the middle. In a jug, mix the yeast into 300ml of lukewarm water, then gradually pour it into the well, stirring and bringing in the flour from the outside to form a dough. </li><li>Knead on a flour-dusted surface for 10 minutes, or until smooth and springy. Place back in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li><li>Meanwhile, destone the olives and peel the garlic (if using), and then pound with the sun-dried tomatoes into a rough paste in a pestle and mortar. Add most of the basil leaves and a small pinch of salt, and bash again until you have a paste. Finely grate in most of the Parmesan, add a big pinch of black pepper, then muddle in 4 tablespoons of olive oil. </li><li>On a lightly floured surface, divide the bread into 2 equal pieces, then roll and stretch out into 2 identical circles roughly about 28cm wide. (If you want to be super-neat you can cut around a dinner plate for a perfect circle shape.) Place one of the circles on a lined baking sheet, then spread the olive paste all over the dough right to the edge, then tear over the mozzarella. Cover with the other circle and press down lightly to seal.  </li><li>Position a jam jar, or something similar, in the centre, and then carefully make 12 evenly spaced cuts, starting from near the glass all the way out to the edge. </li><li>One by one, pick up each piece of bread and twist 3 times before laying neatly back down on the tray, poke in the remaining basil leaves in and around where you can, then cover lightly with a damp cloth and leave to prove again in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size. </li><li>Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas 5. When the bread is ready, finely grate over the remaining cheese and drizzle over a little olive oil, then gently place in the middle of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden. </li><li>Leave to rest for 15 minutes before tucking in.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place a large shallow casserole pan on a medium heat with 250ml of water. Prick the whole aubergines all over with a fork, halve lengthways and place in the pan. Peel, quarter and add the onions, then cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic, and pick the sage leaves. Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6.</li><li>Remove the lid, and once most of the liquid has cooked away, make a well in the middle. Add 3 tablespoons of oil, the garlic, chilli flakes and most of the sage leaves, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Once golden, scrunch in the tomatoes, pour in 2 tins' worth of water, and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Remove the pan from the heat, grate in the cheeses, then season to absolute perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Tear in the pasta sheets and mix up really well to coat and separate, then pull some of the sheets to the top to create a top layer. Bash the almonds until fine and rub the remaining sage leaves with oil, then sprinkle on top. Use the back of a spoon to create some dips and wells, and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling.</li><li>I love this served with a big crunchy green salad dressed with balsamic vinegar.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Soft-boil 4 eggs in a pan of boiling salted water on a medium high heat for 5 minutes exactly, then drain, cool under cold running water, and peel. Tip the grains into a food processor with the curry paste, pick in the mint leaves, then whiz until fairly fine and tacky in texture, adding a splash of water, if needed. Divide into 4 balls. One at a time, pat out on a 15cm square of greaseproof paper, to just under 1cm thick. Place the paper flat on your hand, put a peeled egg in the centre and mould the mixture up and around the egg to seal it inside, using the paper to help you. As it comes together into a ball, remove it from the paper and press gently in your hands to create the perfect covering – patch up any holes as you go. Place the flour in one bowl, beat the remaining egg in another, then whiz the naan to fine crumbs and tip into a third bowl. Cover the coated eggs with flour, dip into the beaten egg and roll in the crumbs until well covered, then chill.</li><li>When you’re ready to cook, just under half-fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go. Carefully lower the Scotch eggs into the pan using a slotted spoon and cook for 8 minutes, or until golden. Scoop out and drain on kitchen paper. Cut in half and serve seasoned lightly with sea salt and with mango chutney for dunking.</li><li>Fantastic with salad for dinner, or serve up half as a starter or lighter bite.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Peel 1 onion, place in a food processor with the mushrooms, rye bread and 1 teaspoon of ground coriander, and whiz until fine. Drain and pulse in the black beans, season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, then divide into 4 and shape into patties, roughly 2.5cm thick. Rub all over with oil and dust with ground coriander, then place on an oiled baking tray and roast for 25 minutes, or until dark and crispy, topping with the Cheddar and warming the rolls for the last few minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile, peel and very finely chop the remaining onion with the tomatoes and place in a bowl. Squeeze over the lime juice, add a few shakes of Tabasco and season to taste. Destone, peel and finely slice the mango and avocado.</li><li>Halve the warm rolls and divide the yoghurt between the bases, followed by half the salsa, the mango, avocado and coriander leaves. Top with the burgers, remaining salsa and extra Tabasco, pop the lids on and press down lightly.</li><li>Always nice with oven-roasted, skin-on chips.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Put the grapes on a griddle pan over a high heat and grill for 5 minutes, or until caramelised and starting to burst open, then place in a large salad bowl. Trim and quarter the radicchio, then dismantle all the leaves. Working in batches, grill, char and soften on both sides, then add to the bowl (this may feel like a very unusual process, but trust me, it’s delicious).</li><li>Once you've grilled the radicchio, turn the heat off (we're going to use the pan to make a warm dressing). Peel and finely slice the garlic, pick the rosemary leaves and place in the still-hot griddle pan with the pine nuts and 2 tablespoons of oil. Keep everything moving for 1 minute, then add the balsamic vinegar (it'll sizzle and smell amazing!), and pour every last bit into the bowl along with the honey. Toss and massage it all together, seasoning to absolute perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Leave to sit for 10 minutes, then toss through the rocket.</li><li>Great as a side salad, or shave over a little goat's cheese and serve with hot toast.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel and very finely slice the onion and garlic, deseed and finely slice the chillies, finely chop the coriander stalks, reserving the leaves, then place in a bowl. Coarsely grate in the paneer and squash (deseed if needed), then peel and finely grate in the ginger. Sprinkle in the flour and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then squeeze over the lime juice. Add the curry paste and 50ml of water, then mix.</li><li>Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat, then roughly divide the mixture into 4 portions and place in the pan, flattening them out into rough rounds, about the width of the buns (don’t worry about wispy edges, it’ll mean bonus crunch later!). Fry for 16 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning every few minutes. Meanwhile, pound most of the coriander leaves to a paste in a pestle and mortar, muddle in the yoghurt, then season to taste. Finely shred the lettuce, halve the burger buns (warm first, if you like), and puff up the dry poppadoms in the microwave for 30 seconds each.</li><li>Divide the coriander yoghurt between the bases and inside bun-lids, then break up the poppadoms and sprinkle over. Place a crispy bhaji burger on top of each bun-base, add a dollop of mango chutney, a few coriander leaves and the lettuce, then pop the tops on and press down lightly.</li><li>Serve with a cold beer and extra fresh chilli if you love a bit of heat (like me!).</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Pick most of the basil leaves into a pestle and mortar and bash to a paste with a pinch of sea salt. Peel and bash in the garlic, then pound in the almonds until fine. Muddle in 4 tablespoons of oil, finely grate in the Parmesan, then squeeze in the lemon juice. Season to perfection, and tweak to your liking.</li><li>Scrub and finely slice the potato, trim just the stalks off the beans, then place both in a pan of boiling salted water with the tagliatelle and cook according to the pasta packet instructions. Prep the delicate summer veg as necessary, adding them to the pan for the last 3 minutes. Drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water, then toss with the pesto, loosening with a splash of reserved cooking water, if needed. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, and finish with the remaining basil and a fine grating of Parmesan. Nice served with a crunchy seasonal salad.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and refresh under cold running water and toss with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. Lightly toast the peanuts in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat until golden, then bash in a pestle and mortar until fine, and tip into a bowl. Peel the garlic and bash to a paste with the tofu, add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, 1 tablespoon of soy, the tamarind paste and chilli sauce, then squeeze and muddle in half the lime juice.</li><li>Peel and finely slice the shallot, then place in the frying pan over a high heat. Trim, prep and slice the crunchy veg, as necessary, then dry-fry for 4 minutes, or until lightly charred (to bring out a nutty, slightly smoky flavour). Add the noodles, sauce, beansprouts, and a good splash of water, toss together over the heat for 1 minute, then divide between serving bowls.</li><li>Wipe out the pan, crack in the eggs and cook to your liking in a little olive oil, sprinkling with a pinch of chilli flakes. Trim the lettuce, click apart the leaves and place a few in each bowl. Pop the eggs on top, pick over the herbs, and sprinkle with the nuts. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over, and extra soy, to taste.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Tear the mushrooms into a bowl, scatter over 15g of sea salt (most of this will drain away later) and scrunch together, then leave for 30 minutes, scrunching occasionally. Tip the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt, then chop and rub in the butter. Make a well in the middle, slowly pour in 200ml of cold water, then mix, pat and bring it together. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.</li><li>After 30 minutes the mushrooms should feel quite soggy, so squeeze firmly to remove as much salty liquid as you can (the mushrooms should end up weighing around 400g). Peel the swede, potatoes and onion and slice into small pieces, roughly the same size and thickness as a pound coin. Mix the veg with the mushrooms, then add the rosemary and a few generous pinches of black pepper.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Divide the pastry into 8, then roll out into 20cm rounds on a clean flour-dusted surface. Divide up the filling, then scrunch and pile it to one side of the middle, leaving a 2.5cm gap around the edges. Lightly brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg, fold over and press the edges down, then twist and crimp with your fingers and thumbs to seal. Eggwash, then place on a lined baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes, or until golden.</li><li>Serve with a watercress and apple salad and a dollop of English mustard.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Cover the porcini with 500ml of boiling water. Peel and finely slice the onions and garlic. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of oil into a large casserole pan over a medium-low heat, add the cinnamon and fry for 1 minute, then add the onion and garlic. Pick in the oregano leaves, pour in the vinegar, then simmer with the lid on for 20 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden, stirring regularly. Meanwhile, slice the aubergines lengthways 1cm thick, then chargrill in batches on a griddle pan.</li><li>Scrub the potatoes and slice 1cm thick, then add to the casserole pan with just the porcini water, reserving the mushrooms. Scrunch the tomatoes into the pan, then pour in 1 tin’s worth of water and leave to tick away on a medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring regularly. Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6.</li><li>Place the mushrooms in a blender with half the feta and the eggs. Pour in the milk, finely grate in half the nutmeg, then whiz until smooth. Season the tomato sauce to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, then spoon half into a 25cm x 35cm baking dish. Cover with half the aubergines, drizzle over 4 tablespoons of creamy sauce, then repeat, finishing with the remaining creamy sauce. Crumble over the rest of the feta, then bake for 40 minutes, or until golden and bubbling.</li><li>Delicious served with a simple lemony dressed green salad.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Peel the onions and halve across the middle. Place the butter in a 26cm non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat. Strip in the thyme leaves and add the bay, shake the pan around and get it bubbling, then add the sugar, vinegar and 100ml of water. Place the onion halves in the pan, cut side down. Peel and halve the garlic cloves and place in the gaps, then season generously with sea salt and black pepper. Cover, turn the heat down to low and leave to steam for 10 minutes to soften the onions slightly, then remove the lid and cook until – very importantly! – the liquid starts to caramelise, gently shaking the pan occasionally to stop it from sticking.</li><li>Place the pastry over the onions, using a wooden spoon to push it right into the edges of the pan. Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed up (it will look quite dark, but don’t worry!). Using oven gloves to protect your hands, pop a large plate over the pan and confidently but very carefully turn out.</li><li>Delicious served with goat’s cheese, a simple salad and a cold beer.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>With the tip of a knife, prick the tomatoes, removing the cores from any larger ones. Carefully plunge them into fast-boiling water for 45 seconds, then drain and peel away the skin. Cover the saffron with 100ml of boiling water and leave to infuse. Toast the almonds in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until golden, then tip into a small bowl and place the pan back on the heat.</li><li>Peel and very finely chop the garlic, ginger and chillies. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into the pan, then add the curry leaves, followed by all the spices. Peel and quarter the onion, click apart into petals, then add to the pan with the garlic, ginger and chilli and fry for 3 minutes, stirring constantly.

Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then scatter over the almonds. Serve with fluffy rice.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>For the pickled shallots, toast the peppercorns, cinnamon, star anise and coriander seeds in a dry frying pan on a medium heat until fragrant. Add 1 teaspoon of salt, 350ml of water and 120ml of vinegar, and bring to the boil.</li><li>Peel and finely slice the shallots into rings and place in a heatproof bowl. Using a sieve, strain over the pickling liquid, then leave to cool and let the flavours mingle (see tip).</li><li>For the edamame dip, prick the jalapeños with a sharp knife and place them directly over a gas hob, turning with tongs until blistered all over. Leave to cool a little before scraping off the black stuff with a knife, then halve and deseed.</li><li>Peel the garlic and shallot, roughly slice the shallot and place in a food processor with the edamame, chillies, 40ml of oil and 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Blitz until super-smooth, adding a splash of water to loosen, if needed. Have a taste and adjust with more vinegar, sea salt and black pepper. Scrape into a bowl, cover and set aside. </li><li>For the dipping sauce, combine all the ingredients in a bowl with 240ml each of vinegar and water and 1 teaspoon of fine salt. Stir  until the sugar has dissolved.</li><li>For the rice rolls, start by prepping the veg. Scrub the carrots, then shave into long ribbons along with the cucumber. Pick the chervil and tarragon, finely slice the grapes and the radishes. Separate the lettuce leaves, wash and dry, then arrange everything, including the micro herbs and beansprouts, on a large platter ready for your guests to assemble.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To make the dressing, halve the lemon, then squeeze the juice into an empty jam jar, using your fingers to catch any pips.</li><li>Add the oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper to the jar.</li><li>Put the lid securely on the jar and shake well.</li><li>Have a taste and see whether you think it needs a bit more lemon juice or oil – you want it to be slightly too acidic, so that it’s still nice and zingy once you’ve dressed your salad leaves.</li><li>Use a knife to trim the roots away from all the lettuces. Separate out the leaves, throwing any tatty ones away.</li><li>Pop them in a colander and give them a good wash under cold running water over the sink.</li><li>Spin them dry in a salad spinner, or wrap in a clean tea towel and shake dry, then pile the leaves into a large salad bowl.</li><li>Pick and add the herbs to the bowl, discarding the stalks.</li><li>From a height, drizzle 3 tablespoons of the dressing over the leaves and gently toss together with the tips of your fingers until every leaf is coated – try not to be heavy-handed and don’t be tempted to overdress or the leaves will go limp.</li><li>Have a taste and add a splash more dressing, if needed – remember you can always add more but you can’t take it away, so be cautious. Pop the lid securely on the jam jar and keep the leftover dressing in the fridge for another day. Serve the salad straightaway.</li><li>PRINT THIS RECIPE <a href="http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/foodrevolution/pdf/simple-green-salad-with-lemon-dressing-fr-uk.pdf">(UK)</a><br/>

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Finely chop the spring onions, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Chop the chillies.</li><li>Heat a good glug of oil in a large, ovenproof pan. Add the spring onions, garlic and bay leaves, and cook over a low heat for 10 minutes, until the spring onions are soft and sweet. </li><li>Bash the cardamom pods and the coriander and cumin seeds with a pestle and mortar and add to the pan with the turmeric, chopped chilli and a couple of hearty pinches of sea salt. Stir for 3 to 4 minutes over a medium heat, until the spices are fragrant. </li><li>Increase the heat, add the rice and a little more oil if needed and stir to coat in the spices. Pour over about 800ml of cold water – you want it to come about 1cm above the rice. Pop the lid on and put the pan into the oven for 25 minutes.</li><li>While the rice is cooking, put the root veg on a baking tray, drizzle with oil, season and pop into the oven to warm up for the last 10 minutes. </li><li>Meanwhile, poach your eggs. Put a shallow pan of water over a medium heat, add a splash of vinegar and, once simmering, break in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. </li><li>Once the veg and rice are done, remove them from the oven and stir them together. Mix through the greens, herbs and lime juice. </li><li>Pile the mixture into bowls, top each one with a poached egg, and serve with the pomegranate seeds scattered on top.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. </li><li>Using a pestle and mortar, grind the fennel and coriander seeds, and chilli flakes until fine. </li><li>Place the cauliflower on a sheet of tin foil, rub in half of the ground spices and 1 tablespoon of oil, and season with sea salt and black pepper.  </li><li>Wrap the cauliflower in the foil, pop it on a roasting tray and bake for 30 minutes, or until tender, removing the foil for the last 15 minutes to give it a gnarly crust. Remove and set aside.</li><li>Peel and finely grate the ginger and 6 cloves of garlic. In a bowl, combine two-thirds of the ginger, the grated garlic and the remaining half of the spice mixture. </li><li>Make an incision in each aubergine with a small sharp knife, then rub the ginger mixture into each one, along with a drizzle of oil. </li><li>Place the aubergines in a small roasting tray and cook in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until softened and starting to split. Set aside. </li><li>Make your spice blend.

Halve the pomegranate and bash it, cut side down, with a wooden spoon so the seeds come tumbling out. Scatter the seeds over the curry, then serve with chapatis on the side.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Halve the lemongrass, peel the ginger, and peel and roughly chop the garlic and shallots. Pick the coriander leaves and finely chop the stalks.</li><li>Place the lemongrass, ginger, ground coriander, garlic, chillies (leave the seeds in, unless you don’t like it hot), shallots, lime leaves and coriander stalks in a food processor with a good drizzle of oil and blitz to a paste. Add the soy sauce and blitz again. </li><li>Heat a little oil in a big saucepan and fry the paste for 1 minute, stirring all the time. Stir in the stock and coconut milk. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. </li><li>Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Add the noodles and beansprouts and cook for 3 minutes.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 220ºC/gas 7.</li><li>Trim and halve the brussels sprouts, then place on a large baking tray. Add the oil, grate over the lemon zest, then sprinkle with the chilli flakes and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Mix with your hands to coat.</li><li>Roast in the oven for 10 minutes – the sprouts should start to caramelise in places; when that happens, scatter over the Parmesan and roast for a further 15 minutes, until the cheese is crisp and golden brown, and the sprouts tender.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel and finely chop the shallots and garlic, and roughly chop all the fresh mushrooms. Pick the thyme leaves and tear the stale bread into small chunks.</li><li>Lightly toast the nuts in a dry frying pan, then roughly chop. Pick and roughly chop the parsley.</li><li>Cover the porcini with 300ml of boiling water and leave aside to rehydrate.</li><li>Heat the oil in a large, wide pan and add the shallot and garlic. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes or until the shallot is softened but not coloured. </li><li>Drain the soaked porcini over a bowl, reserving the liquid. Add these and the rest of the mushrooms to the pan along with the bay and thyme leaves and cook until all the mushrooms are well softened. If they release a lot of liquid, pour it onto the diced bread and carry on cooking. </li><li>When the mushrooms are tender and browned, tip the mixture into a large bowl and leave to cool completely. </li><li>Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. </li><li>Once the cooked mushroom mixture has cooled, add the chunks of bread, a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the pecans or hazelnuts and about half of the porcini’s reserved soaking liquid (make sure you pour it through a sieve first to stop any grit getting through). Combine well. </li><li>If the stuffing seems too dry, just add a little more of the reserved porcini liquid. </li><li>Add most of the parsley and stir it through then tip the stuffing into a lightly greased baking dish of approximately 20cm x 25cm and cover with foil. </li><li>Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes, then remove the foil and cook for a further 10 minutes. Scatter over the rest of the chopped parsley before serving.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 190ºC/gas 5 and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. </li><li>Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about 5mm thick. Using a small cutter or wine glass, about 6cm across, cut out 12 rounds (you may need to re-roll the pastry). </li><li>Place the circles on the baking tray and prick their centres several times with a fork. Beat the egg, then eggwash the circles. Bake on the top shelf of the oven for about 12 minutes until puffed up, crisp and golden. <br/>
<br/>
Roughly chop or tear the mushrooms, peel and finely slice the garlic, and crumble the chilli (if using). Pick and roughly chop the parsley.</li><li>Heat a lug of oil in a large pan and cook the mushrooms, garlic and chilli (if using), until golden. </li><li>Off the heat, squeeze in the lemon juice, then add the crème fraîche. Season well and fold through the parsley. If the mushrooms are too dry, add a splash of water to loosen the sauce. </li><li>For the vol-au-vents, cut a very thin layer off the top of each circle and use your knife to carefully hollow out a hole in each one.</li><li>Fill with the creamy mushrooms and serve – you can pop the pastry lids back on, if you wish.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/gas 4. Halve and core the pears (you’ll be using 1 for decoration), and place them all cut-side up in an ovenproof dish. </li><li>Sprinkle over ½ a teaspoon of cinnamon and the caraway seeds and pop in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until they’re just browning at the edges and the flesh is soft. Allow to cool.</li><li>Place the walnuts and pine nuts on a baking tray and toast in the oven for 4 to 5 minutes – the pine nuts won’t take long to turn golden, so keep an eye on them. Set aside a few toasted pine nuts for serving.</li><li>Once the pears have cooled, scoop most of the flesh out of 4 of the halves, leaving just enough so the sides don’t collapse. </li><li>Chop up 4 other roasted pear halves and pop in a food processor with the scooped-out pear flesh and toasted nuts. Add the stem ginger and the rest of the cinnamon and blitz. You want a paste that’s quite textured, not totally smooth.</li><li>Divide the pear mixture between the scooped-out pear skins. Peel and core the reserved pear, slice it thinly lengthways and arrange a couple of slivers on top of each stuffed pear.</li><li>Decorate with a few chopped toasted pine nuts and serve, warmed through or cold. It’s great with a little peppery salad, like rocket leaves, on the side.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. </li><li>Deseed the squash and place on a roasting tray, drizzle with the oil, scatter over the chilli flakes and strip over the thyme leaves. Roast for 45 minutes, or until soft. </li><li>Allow to cool a bit, then spoon out the flesh and discard the skin, then place in a bowl.</li><li>Crumble the Stilton and chop the walnuts, then add to the bowl along with the breadcrumbs. Mix to combine, then set aside to cool. </li><li>Beat the egg. Roll out the puff pastry to 18cm x 60cm, then cut into 2 long thin strips. </li><li>Lay half the squash mix down the centre of each strip and brush the long edges with beaten egg, then fold over lengthways and press together to seal. </li><li>Turn the rolls so the join is underneath, then cut into 5cm pieces and place on baking sheets lined with parchment. </li><li>Brush the tops with beaten egg, sprinkle with sesame seeds and bake for 35 minutes, till puffed up and golden.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Make the risotto base first. Soak the dried porcini in a little boiling water. Trim and finely chop the celery, and peel and finely chop the onions and garlic.</li><li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over a low heat. Add the celery and onion, and cook for 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Add the garlic and cook for another minute or two.</li><li>Turn up the heat and add the rice. Cook for a minute or so until you hear it snap, crackle and pop, then add the wine and stir until absorbed.</li><li>Drain the porcini, sieve and discard any grit from the liquid and add to the risotto pan, stirring until absorbed. Finely chop the porcini and add to the pan. </li><li>Add the hot stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring each one in until it has been completely absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir as much as you can – this is what will make it creamy. Once the rice is al dente (when you break into a grain, it should be almost cooked through but still have a white fleck in the middle), transfer to a bowl to cool. </li><li>Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375°F/gas 5.</li><li>Fry the wild mushrooms in a little oil over a medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until they are just starting to crisp.</li><li>Toast, then bash the nuts into coarse pieces, or quickly pulse in a food processor.</li><li>Coarsely grate the Cheddar, finely chop the chilli and finely grate the lemon zest.

Put the cider vinegar, shallot, bay leaves, spices and 150ml water in a stainless-steel saucepan along with a few good pinches of sea salt. Bring to the boil then simmer for 5 minutes or so to give the aromatics time to flavour the liquid. </li><li>Peel and cut the celery into 5cm chunks. Drop the celery into the pickling liquid and simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes, or until the celery is heated through but still with a good bit of crunch; this really depends on how thick the stalks are. While the celery is poaching in the pickle, crush the olives gently with your thumb to flatten them down to the stone. Don’t remove the stones, but drop the squashed olives in with the celery for the last minute of cooking. </li><li>Pour the pan’s contents through a sieve set over a bowl (discard the pickling liquid or use once again) and leave to drain and cool.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel and finely chop the onions and garlic, pick the coriander leaves and finely chop the stalks, finely chop the jalapeño, and roughly chop the tomatoes. </li><li>Place a large non-stick saucepan over a medium heat and pour in a lug of oil. Add the onions, coriander stalks and jalapeño and sauté for 10 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Stir in the coriander seeds, fry for a couple more minutes, then add the lentils. </li><li>Stir in 800ml boiling water and bring back to the boil. Season well, reduce the heat, pop on the lid and simmer for 40 minutes, until the lentils are cooked and beginning to break down. </li><li>Blacken the peppers by either placing them directly on a gas flame, or griddling them in a griddle pan, turning regularly until blackened all over. Pop them in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and let stand. </li><li>After about 5 minutes the peppers should be ready, so flake away the blistered skin and remove the stalk and seeds. Slice the flesh into thin strips and leave to one side. </li><li>Place the chipotle chilli in a small bowl and pour in just enough boiling water to cover. After a few minutes, it should have softened; carefully remove from the bowl and finely chop.</li><li>Place a medium-sized pan over a medium heat and pour in a lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and all the chillies and fry for 1 minute, then add the peppers and paprika. Fry for a few more minutes, then add the tomatoes. </li><li>Season well and gradually bring everything to a simmer. Leave to bubble away gently for 10 minutes, until you have a thick and rich tomato sauce. Add a splash of red wine vinegar and set aside. Chop the coriander leaves, then stir through.</li><li>When your lentils are cooked, roughly purée with a stick blender, then pop back over a medium heat with a lug of oil. Fry for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, so you end up with crispy fried lentils. </li><li>Place a frying pan over a medium heat and add a splash of oil. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, and cook to your liking. Slice the avocados and dress with the juice of 1 lime. Cut the remaining lime into quarters.</li><li>Serve the refried lentils with a dollop of the red pepper salsa, dressed avocado and topped with a fried egg and a wedge of lime.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Top and tail the gooseberries, discarding the hard ends, and place in a large saucepan. If you’re using elderflowers, tie them up in a piece of muslin and secure with string, then add to the saucepan. If using cordial, add to the pan with 150ml water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the fruit is tender and has broken down nicely. Remove from the heat, squeeze any liquid out of the elderflower parcel and discard. </li><li>Split the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape out the seeds. Add the sugar and the vanilla pod and seeds to the pan and boil over a high heat for about 10 minutes, skimming off any foam that forms on the surface. Pour through a strainer into sterilised jars and leave to cool before putting sealing with the lids.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. </li><li>Halve and deseed the squash, then carefully chop into 3cm chunks. In a large roasting tray, toss and massage it with 1 teaspoon of oil, the ground coriander and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. </li><li>Deseed the peppers and cut into 3cm chunks, then, in a separate tray, toss and massage them with 1 teaspoon of oil and the smoked paprika. Place both trays in the oven for 35 minutes, or until softened.</li><li>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop ¼ of an onion and put aside, then roughly chop the rest and place in a large casserole pan on a low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Crush in the garlic, add the bay leaves and a good splash of water and cook for 20 minutes, or until soft, stirring regularly. </li><li>Tip in the beans, juice and all, then half-fill each empty tin with water, swirl and pour into the pan. Simmer until the time is up on the squash and peppers, then stir both into the pan. </li><li>Trim, finely slice and add the okra, and simmer for a further 20 minutes, or until the feijoada is dark and delicious, loosening with an extra splash of water, if needed. </li><li>Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions, then drain.</li><li>To make a quick salsa, deseed the tomatoes, then finely chop with as much chilli as you like and most of the coriander leaves. Scrape into a bowl with the reserved finely chopped onion and toss with the lime juice, then season to perfection. </li><li>Remove 4 portions of feijoada, bag them up and once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day, when you’ll be really grateful it’s there. </li><li>Serve the remaining feijoada with the rice and salsa, a spoonful of yoghurt and a sprinkling of the remaining coriander leaves.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Wrap the tofu in a clean tea towel, then squeeze and wring it out to remove the excess liquid (about 4 tablespoons should come out – it’s messy, but really important to do this for great burger texture later). </li><li>Place the tofu in a bowl, scraping it off the tea towel. Crack in the egg, then add the breadcrumbs and Marmite. Mix and scrunch together really well with clean hands, then shape into 4 even-sized patties that’ll fit nicely in your buns once cooked. </li><li>Roughly chop the tomatoes and put into a dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat with a pinch of black pepper, a splash of water and the vinegar. </li><li>Squash the tomatoes with a potato masher, cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thick and delicious, then tear in the basil leaves and season to perfection (I sometimes add a pinch of dried red chilli flakes too, for a kick). </li><li>If you want to plump up your buns, pop them into a warm oven for a few minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile, finely slice or prep all the salad veg. </li><li>Next, pick the basil leaves into a blender and blitz with all the other dressing ingredients and a pinch of salt and pepper until super-smooth. </li><li>Place 2 teaspoons of oil in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Pick the rosemary leaves into the pan in four piles, place the patties on top and cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden. </li><li>Slice or grate the cheese, place on the patties, reduce the heat to low, then cover and leave to melt for 3 to 4 minutes. </li><li>Spread the tomato sauce into the buns, then sandwich the cheesy burgers and sliced gherkins inside. </li><li>Toss the salad with half the dressing (save the rest for another day), serve alongside the burgers and enjoy – totally awesome.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Prep your ingredients before you start – peel and cut the onions into wedges, then peel and finely slice the garlic. Trim the aubergines and courgettes, deseed the peppers and chop into 2.5cm chunks. Roughly chop the tomatoes. Pick the basil leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks.</li><li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large casserole pan or saucepan over a medium heat, add the chopped aubergines, courgettes and peppers (you may need to do this in batches) and fry for around 5 minutes, or until golden and softened, but not cooked through. Spoon the cooked veg into a large bowl.</li><li>To the pan, add the onion, garlic, basil stalks and thyme leaves with another drizzle of oil, if needed.

Cover the pan and simmer over a low heat for 30 to 35 minutes, or until reduced, sticky and sweet. </li><li>Tear in the basil leaves, finely grate in the lemon zest and adjust the seasoning, if needed. Serve with a hunk of bread or steamed rice.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place the frozen veg in a food processor and let them defrost for around 15 minutes.</li><li>Add the coriander (stalks and all), flour, cumin and cayenne, season well with sea salt and black pepper, then blitz to a rough paste. Pulse in the sesame and sunflower seeds until combined.</li><li>Divide the mixture and shape into 4 equal-sized patties, roughly 2cm thick. Place on a lightly flour-dusted tray, turning them in the flour to coat. Firm up in the freezer for 10 minutes, then transfer to the fridge.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas 3, while you make the vegan mayo and onion rings.</li><li>For the mayo, trim and roughly chop the spring onions and chilli (deseeded if you like) and place in a blender. Peel and add the garlic, along with the chickpeas, mustard, tomato paste, brandy, lemon juice and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Blitz well to combine, then, with the blender still running, slowly pour in 4 to 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil until smooth and the same consistency as mayonnaise.</li><li>For the onion rings, peel the onion and slice horizontally into 2cm-wide rounds. Separate into rings, then place in a bowl with the vinegar and a pinch of salt. Leave for 5 minutes. </li><li>Meanwhile, combine the flour and baking powder in a bowl, then gently whisk in the ale until smooth, thick and coating the back of a spoon nicely.</li><li>Place a medium, deep pan over a high heat, pour in the sunflower or sunseed oil and allow to heat up. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a piece of bread into the pan – if it floats to the surface, sizzles and turns golden, it’s about right. </li><li>Drain the onions, dust a handful of them with flour until lightly coated, then dip them into the batter. Remove with a slotted spoon and allow any excess batter to drip off, then carefully lower into the hot oil.</li><li>Cook for around 1 minute, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway with the slotted spoon. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining onion.</li><li>When you’re ready, cook the burgers in 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway and pressing down with a fish slice to get them nice and crispy.</li><li>Transfer to a baking tray, then pop into the oven while you prepare the remaining ingredients.</li><li>Finely shred the lettuce and mix with half the vegan mayo (keep the rest in the fridge for up to 2 days). Slice the tomatoes and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper. </li><li>Sprinkle over a little salt and pick over the basil leaves.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Three obvious things are important on your journey to perfection – your choice of potato, your choice of oil and your choice of salt. For me, the Maris Piper potato wins every time, and you want to use nice large ones. </li><li>On oil, sunflower and sunseed are very efficient, and many people swear by using groundnut oil. But, if you’re after flavour, cooking chips in beef tallow (rendered beef fat you can get from your butcher) gives you better flavour and colour – the choice is yours. </li><li>Finally, on salt, being an Essex boy, in my house it has to be Maldon sea salt.</li><li>So down to business: chop 800g of Maris Piper potatoes into finger-sized chips, leaving the skin on – don’t be too exact. </li><li>Chip shops have massive industrial fryers, which you can’t recreate at home, so you need to use a large sturdy pan on a medium to high heat (unless you own a deep-fat fryer, of course). Your oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full. If you don’t have a thermometer, use a raw chip, and as it starts to float and fry the temperature should be about 140°C, which is perfect for blanching. </li><li>Use a large metal sieve to gently lower the chips into the pan for around 8 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, then remove to a tray to cool.</li><li>Turn the heat up under the oil and return one blanched chip to the oil as a guide again. Once it’s floating and golden the temperature should be about 180°C, which is perfect for frying and will give you chips with those all-important crispy outsides and fluffy middles. </li><li>At this stage you may want to cook your chips in 2-portion batches, so you don’t decrease the temperature of the oil too much or overcrowd the pan. Fry the chips until beautifully golden, then remove to a bowl lined with kitchen paper, shake around a bit, season with sea salt and serve right away.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Peel and trim the parsnips, cutting them into batons approximately 5cm long and 1cm thick. Finely chop the shallot and crush the garlic for the dressing.</li><li>Bring the stock to the boil, add the lentils and bay leaf and simmer gently for 25–30 minutes, or until the lentils are just tender but still retain some bite. Drain the lentils, discard the bay and set aside.</li><li>Place the walnuts on a baking tray and toast in the oven until lightly browned and fragrant. Remove the tray from the oven, carefully scoop out the walnuts, and add the parsnips in their place. Drizzle with the olive oil and roast for 35 minutes until golden.</li><li>Make the dressing by whisking together the walnut oil, vinegar, honey and mustard. Season and stir in the garlic and shallots.</li><li>In a bowl, toss together the lentils, walnuts, parsnips and dressing. Place the watercress or rocket onto plates, pile on the lentil salad and shave over some vegetarian hard cheese.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. </li><li>Place the pine nuts on a baking tray and roast in the oven until golden, set aside to cool down.  </li><li>Trim the outer leaves and base from the cauliflower, then cut into small florets. </li><li>Trim the ends from the Brussels sprouts and slice in half, keeping hold of the loose leaves. </li><li>Cover the raisins in boiling water, leave for about 20 minutes, then drain and set aside.  </li><li>Place the cauliflower florets and sprouts in a large roasting pan, scatter over the saffron threads, then pour over 2 tablespoons each of the olive and garlic oils. Season well and mix together gently. </li><li>Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, until the florets and sprouts are tender and starting to caramelise. You may find that the loose sprout leaves start to really crisp up; don’t be alarmed, it adds a lovely smoky element to the overall flavour.  </li><li>Transfer the roasted cauliflower and sprouts to a serving bowl and add the pine nuts and raisins. Season to taste, then give the whole mixture a gentle stir to ensure everything is combined and coated in the saffron oil, and then serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Begin by trimming the leaves from the beetroot, leaving about 2.5cm of stalk on each one. Place in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and leave to simmer gently, partially covered, for 40 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li><li>Finely grate the zest of one of the lemons into a bowl and squeeze in the juice from both, passing it through a fine sieve, to ensure no pith or pips remain. </li><li>Finely chop the dill and onion, and add to the bowl with the sugar, olive oil, capers and 1 teaspoon of sea salt. Whisk all of the ingredients together until fully amalgamated.</li><li>Run the beetroots under a cold tap and gently slide off the skins (they should peel off easily). Trim the tops and bottoms from the beetroots and discard. Then, using a mandolin or a sharp knife, slice the beetroot into very thin rounds. </li><li>Arrange the beetroot slices on a serving platter or individual plates and spoon over the dressing, letting it sink into every crevice of the beetroots. Cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven and a large baking tray to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Start by making the pastry. Sift the flour and xanthan gum into a food processor, add the margarine, vegetable shortening and a pinch of sea salt, and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and cut together with the flat of a knife.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of cold water, pulsing as you go (or stirring with a flat-bladed knife, if making the pastry by hand), until the mixture begins to pull together to form a dough. </li><li>Tip the pastry into a large bowl (or keep in the same bowl, if making it by hand) and, using your fingertips, pull together into a ball. Knead lightly for about 2 minutes  or until smooth and elastic. </li><li>Shape the pastry into a ball and place between 2 large sheets of clingfilm, then roll it out into a circle slightly larger than the tart tin and no thinner than 3mm. Peel off the uppermost sheet of clingfilm and carefully flip the pastry into a deep 23cm tart tin. Peel away the remaining clingfilm and gently press the pastry into the sides of the tin, filling in any cracks with pastry and patting it flat with your fingertips. Trim the edges and set aside.</li><li>Next, prepare the potatoes. Peel and cut in half, quartering any large ones. Place in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. The second the water begins to boil, time the potatoes, allowing them to cook for  4 minutes before removing from the heat and draining. Shake the potatoes in the colander a little to chuff up the edges – this helps them crisp up. </li><li>Pour 8 tablespoons of the groundnut oil into a large roasting tin, tip in the potatoes and 1 heaped teaspoon of sea salt and firmly shake to coat evenly. Set aside while you make the filling for the tart.</li><li>Finely chop the onion, crush the garlic, then finely grate the carrots. Trim the stalks from the chestnut mushrooms and slice into rounds. Halve 240g of the chestnuts (the rest will be used for the topping).  </li><li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the onions and cook gently over a low heat until softened. Add the carrots, garlic, thyme and mushrooms, and fry gently until softened and all of the liquid from the mushrooms has been absorbed – around 10 minutes.  </li><li>Stir in the cream cheese and halved chestnuts and mix together gently until the cheese has softened and formed a creamy mixture. Season to taste, spoon the filling into the pastry case then level the top. </li><li>Place the tart on the baking tray on the top shelf of the oven and the potatoes on the bottom shelf. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the pastry is crisp.  </li><li>Remove the tart from the oven, cover loosely in foil to retain its heat and set aside. Move the potatoes to the top shelf of the oven and increase the temperature to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Continue roasting the potatoes for a further 25 to 30 minutes until golden and crisp.</li><li>For the gravy, heat the walnut oil and redcurrant jelly in a small saucepan, stirring until melted and smooth. Add the hot stock, bring to a simmer and stir in the cornflour. Simmer gently and stir continuously until you have the desired consistency. Set aside.</li><li>Finally, tear the wild mushrooms into pieces, roughly chop the remaining chestnuts and finely chop the parsley. Heat the garlic oil in a heavy-based frying pan until hot, add the mushrooms and fry gently until softened. Stir in the chestnuts, cranberries and parsley, and spoon over the tart to form a decorative layer. Reheat the gravy and serve with the tart and roast potatoes.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180C/350ºF/gas 4. </li><li>For the nut roast crust, roughly chop the pistachios, then spread out on a baking tray with the seeds, then toast in the oven for 5 to 6 minutes.</li><li>When the time's up, transfer to a food processor, along with the chestnut purée, suet and maple syrup, and blitz until the mixture comes together into a ball. It will be very sticky to begin with, so stop and scrape the sides as you go. </li><li>Place a large sheet of baking parchment on a work surface and sit the dough on it. Then, with lots of gluten-free flour on your hands and rolling pin, roll out the dough as thinly as possible (less than 5mm). </li><li>If you’re making individual tartlets, oil and flour four 10cm loose-bottomed tart tins, then cut out the pastry to size. Or, roll out the dough and cut to the size of a large baking tin, then transfer to the tin using a fish slice. </li><li>Prick the dough all over with a fork, cover with baking parchment, fill with baking beans or uncooked rice and bake blind for 12 to 15 minutes. Leave to cool completely in the baking tray, as it will be quite delicate straight from the oven. Keep the oven on. </li><li>For the topping, chop the sweet potato into cubes, then place on a baking tray. Toss with a little oil, then bake for 25 minutes, or until soft. </li><li>Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, slice and add the mushrooms along with 1 teaspoon of cracked black pepper, and sauté for 6 to 8 minutes, until the mushrooms brown. </li><li>Blitz the roasted sweet potato in a food processor with the crème fraîche, nutmeg and ½ a tablespoon of cracked black pepper (or to taste) to a smooth, creamy consistency. </li><li>To assemble the tart, crumble the blue cheese over the base, arrange the sautéed mushrooms on top, then finish with the sweet potato mix. </li><li>Sprinkle with linseed, roughly chop and scatter over the pistachios followed by the sunflower seeds, then add a drizzle of rapeseed oil, and pop back in the oven for 6 to 7 minutes until it just starts to brown. Serve hot with gravy and roast vegetables.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Spread out the nuts and seeds on a baking tray and toast in the oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a food processor, along with the chestnut purée, suet and maple syrup, and blitz until it comes together into a ball. It will be sticky to begin with, so stop and scrape the sides as you go. </li><li>Place a large sheet of greaseproof paper on a work surface and sit the dough on it. Then, with lots of gluten-free flour on your hands and rolling pin, roll out the dough as thinly as possible (less than 5mm). </li><li>If you’re making individual tartlets, oil and flour four 10cm loose-bottomed tart tins, then cut the pastry to size. For 1 large tart, roll out the dough and cut to the size of a large, shallow baking tin, and transfer to the tin using a fish slice. </li><li>Prick the pastry all over with a fork, cover with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans or rice and bake blind for 12 to 15 minutes. Leave to cool in the tray, and keep the oven on. </li><li>Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil in a pan over a medium heat, then sauté the mushrooms for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden. Remove and set aside. </li><li>In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of rapeseed oil and wilt the spinach (or heat through if frozen) along with the pepper. Blitz the spinach, avocado flesh, tofu, nutmeg and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth. </li><li>Thinly slice the sweet potato using a vegetable peeler or mandolin, creating a pile of peelings. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a small pan, then fry the peelings over a high heat, turning occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, until just turning crisp. </li><li>Assemble the tart by spreading the spinach mixture over the baked and cooled tart base. Lay the mushrooms on top, and decorate with the sweet potato slivers and a scattering of toasted pine nuts. Eat at room temperature, or heat it up, if you like.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Finely dice the red pepper and onion, and put on a baking tray. Drizzle over 2 teaspoons of rapeseed oil, sprinkle with black pepper and roast for about 15 minutes, until the vegetables start to brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. </li><li>Grease and line a 30cm x 20cm baking tin with greaseproof paper. For the base, pop the polenta, flours, baking powder, ½ a teaspoon of sea salt, black onion seeds and capers in a mixing bowl and stir. </li><li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, milk and corn oil. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, pour in the wet ingredients and stir with a spatula until well combined. </li><li>Spread the cooled onion and pepper mixture over the prepared baking tin. Spoon the batter on top and carefully spread to the edges. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. </li><li>Remove the tin from the oven and turn the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. </li><li>Let the bumble-o cool slightly, then spoon the onion marmalade on and spread it to the edges.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To make the filling, peel and finely slice the garlic and ginger. Pick the coriander leaves and set aside, then finely slice the stalks. Heat a splash of groundnut oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, then add the garlic, ginger and coriander stalks. Fry for around 3 minutes, or until golden. Slice the mushrooms, then add to the pan for around 5 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.</li><li>Add the vinegar, chilli sauce and soy, then cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the liquid has boiled and bubbled away and the mushrooms are golden brown and starting to caramelise. Transfer to a bowl. </li><li>Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then add the white part to the bowl. Deseed and finely slice the chilli, then add half to the bowl, reserving the rest for later. Stir in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, then set aside.</li><li>Add the coconut milk, 2 heaped tins’ worth of flour and a good pinch of sea salt to a food processor. Whiz to a dough, then transfer to a flour-dusted surface and roll into a thick sausage. Cut into 12 equal-sized pieces, roll into balls, then flatten into rounds, roughly ½cm thick. </li><li>Equally divide the mushroom mixture between each of the 12 dough circles (you'll need roughly 1 tablespoon of filling per circle), making sure to leave a 2cm gap around the edges.

Sprinkle with the oregano, then pick, finely chop and add the parsley. Season generously with sea salt and black pepper. </li><li>Combine well with your hands and transfer to a large ovenproof dish. Drizzle with any remaining oil. </li><li>Bake for 30 minutes, then turn the oven down to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until the top has browned and vegetables are tender. Allow to cool slightly before serving.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat your oven to full whack. Prick each of your chillies and the pepper (if you're only using 4 chillies, you'll need the pepper to bulk up the filling) with a small, sharp knife, then blacken over a gas flame, in a dry griddle pan or under a grill. Once they’re nicely charred, pop them in a bowl and cover with clingfilm. </li><li>After 10 minutes, remove the skin, stalks and seeds, then delicately tear lengthways into thin strips. Put these strips back in the bowl and add the red wine vinegar and a lug of olive oil. Pick the parsley leaves and finely chop the stalks. Stir the stalks into the bowl, reserving the leaves for later.</li><li>Peel and finely chop the garlic. Heat a lug of olive oil and some butter in a small ovenproof frying pan, then add half of your marinated chillies and the garlic. </li><li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl with some grated Parmesan and a good pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Put a few of your parsley leaves to one side, then finely chop the rest and add them to the eggs.</li><li>Pour the eggs into the pan, then crumble in half of the goat’s cheese or feta. Move the pan a bit to spread everything around. </li><li>When the egg is just starting to set, crumble over most of the remaining goat’s cheese, then pop the frittata in a hot oven for 5 minutes or until it doubles in size.</li><li>Some people cook their frittatas all the way through, but I prefer mine only just done. Once it’s out of the oven, delicately drape the rest of your chilli over the top, crumble over the last few bits of goat’s cheese or feta, then drizzle over a little of the chilli marinade. Sprinkle with the reserved parsley and serve with something fresh and lovely, like a rocket, lemon and Parmesan salad.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place the ingredients in a food processor and blitz to a rough dough. Tip out onto a flour-dusted surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes, or until smooth. </li><li>Cut the dough into four pieces, then carefully press a portion out flat with your fingertips and start to roll it out using a pasta machine. Start at the widest setting and roll the dough through it, lightly dusting with the rice flour if it sticks. Roll the pasta through the widest setting a second time, then click the machine down a setting and roll the dough through again. </li><li>Now, start clicking the settings down, rolling the pasta through each setting twice – gluten-free pasta isn’t as elastic as standard pasta, so make sure you avoid using the two narrowest settings, otherwise it may rip. Once you have a thin sheet of pasta (about 2mm thick), set aside on a flour-dusted surface and cover with a damp tea towel to avoid it drying out, then continue with the remaining dough.</li><li>Now’s the time to transform your dough into whichever variety of pasta you like. If you want to make tagliatelle, roll the pasta through the tagliatelle setting on your pasta machine, or use a sharp knife to slice the pasta sheets lengthways into long strips (roughly 7mm thick), placing on a flour-dusted tray as you go. To cook, place in a pan of boiling salted water for around 3 minutes, or until al dente, then serve how you like it.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel and roughly chop the onion on a chopping board, then place in a large bowl.</li><li>Trim and roughly chop the celery and leek (make sure you wash it really well), then peel and finely chop the garlic and add it all to the onion.</li><li>Place a large pot on a medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil.</li><li>Once hot, add all the chopped vegetables, turn the heat down to low and cook with the lid askew for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender, stirring occasionally. </li><li>Peel the potatoes using a Y-shaped peeler, then chop into rough 2cm chunks and place in the empty bowl. Chop the courgettes into rough 2cm chunks and place in the bowl with the potatoes.</li><li>Fill and boil the kettle.</li><li>Once the vegetables are cooked, add the potatoes, courgettes and a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper.</li><li>Crumble the stock cube (if using) into a measuring jug and carefully top up to 1.4 litres with boiling water and stir until dissolved. Carefully pour the hot stock into the pot. </li><li>Turn the heat up to high and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until the potato is cooked through.</li><li>Add the peas or beans and the spinach and cook for a further 4  minutes, or until the peas are tender.</li><li>Carefully remove the pot to a heatproof surface and leave for a minute or two to stop bubbling.</li><li>Carefully blitz with a stick blender until smooth (use a tea towel to protect your hands from little splashes). Have a taste and add a tiny pinch of salt and pepper if you think it needs it.</li><li>Pick and roughly chop the mint leaves, discarding the stalks.</li><li>Carefully ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle over the mint. Delicious served with homemade croutons (see tip below).</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Wash the beetroots and carrots under cold running water, scrubbing with a scrubber to get rid of any dirt (there’s no need to peel them).</li><li>Pick off and discard the wispy ends from the beetroots.</li><li>Hold a box grater steady on a chopping board, then gripping the root end, coarsely grate the carrots, stopping before your fingers or knuckles get too close to the grater. Place the grated carrots into a large bowl.</li><li>Coarsely grate or finely slice the cabbage, then discard the core and add to the bowl.</li><li>Remove the stalk from the pear, coarsely grate (core and all), then place it into the bowl.</li><li>Finally, hold the root end of the beetroots and coarsely grate (you may want to wear rubber gloves for this), then add to the bowl.</li><li>Pick the mint and parsley leaves, then discard the stalks. Tear or finely chop the leaves on a board and add to the bowl.</li><li>Add all the dressing ingredients to a jam jar.</li><li>Put the lid securely on the jar and shake well.</li><li>Have a taste and see whether you think it needs a bit more yoghurt, vinegar or oil – you want it to be slightly too acidic, so that it’s still nice and zingy once you’ve dressed your rainbow salad. </li><li>Drizzle most of the dressing over the salad – just remember you can always add more but you can’t take it away, so be cautious.</li><li>Divide the salad between the tortilla wraps, then crumble a little feta over each.</li><li>Roll up the wraps, tucking them in at the sides as you go, then serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To make the dressing, trim and finely slice the spring onions, then place the green pieces in a large bowl. Quarter and add the tomatoes along with 6 tablespoons of oil, the zest from half the lemon and most of the juice. Season, then set the dressing aside. Squeeze the remaining lemon juice over the white part of the onions and set aside.</li><li>Pick and set aside the mint leaves, then tie the stalks together with string. Place the stalks and broad beans into a pan of boiling salted water, then blanch for around 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broad beans to a bowl, discarding the mint stalks. Add the peas to the boiling water and blanch for 2 minutes. </li><li>Meanwhile, pod any larger broad beans and add to the dressing, then drain and add the peas. Finely slice and add most of the mint leaves, then toss everything well to coat.</li><li>Toast the sourdough in a griddle pan over a high heat. Halve the garlic and rub the cut side onto one side of the griddled bread, then rub over the rosemary. Sprinkle with a little salt and drizzle over some oil. </li><li>Pile the peas and broad beans onto the dressed side of your toast. Sprinkle over the white spring onion and the reserved mint leaves, then grate the remaining lemon zest on top. Use a speed-peeler to shave the feta over the top, then serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. </li><li>Peel the potatoes and carrots, then coarsely grate them in a food processor or by hand on a box grater. Add a good pinch of sea salt, toss and scrunch it all together, then leave for 5 minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile, mix the mustard, a good squeeze of lemon juice, and a couple of lugs of extra virgin olive oil with a little pinch of salt and black pepper in a medium bowl and put aside.</li><li>Drizzle a really good lug of olive oil into a large bowl and add a good pinch of pepper. Handful by handful, squeeze the potato and carrot mixture to get rid of the excess salty liquid, then sprinkle into the bowl. </li><li>Toss in the oil and pepper until well mixed, then evenly scatter it over a large oiled baking tray (roughly 30cm x 40cm). Roast for around 35 minutes, or until golden on top and super-crispy around the edges.</li><li>Meanwhile, blanch the peas for a minute in a large pan of boiling salted water, then scoop out, add to the bowl of dressing and pile the spinach on top. </li><li>Just before your rösti is ready, with the water gently simmering, crack in the eggs, poach to your liking, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon. </li><li>Serve the rösti with the eggs on top. Quickly toss the salad together to dress it and scatter in piles on the rösti, then crumble over the feta and serve. I like to whack it in the middle of the table and let everyone dig in.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel the ginger and garlic and finely grate into a large bowl. </li><li>Add the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and a pinch of black pepper, then mix to make a dressing. </li><li>Trim and shred the cabbage and put it into a large pan of boiling salted water with the broccoli (cut into florets first, if using fresh) and noodles to cook for around 3 minutes, then add the mangetout for a final minute. </li><li>Drain it all well, then toss in the bowl of dressing.</li><li>Fry the eggs in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with a lug of olive oil until cooked to your liking (I like mine with a runny yolk). </li><li>Divide the noodles between bowls, pop an egg on top of each one, and serve drizzled with chilli sauce for that all-important added kick.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Run a fork down the length of the cucumber until it’s stripy all over.</li><li>On a chopping board, use a knife to chop off the ends.</li><li>Carefully cut them in half across the middle, then in half lengthways.</li><li>Use a teaspoon to gently scoop out and discard the seeds.</li><li>Chop the cucumber up into 1cm chunks and place in a mixing bowl.</li><li>Place the olives on a chopping board, squash them with the heel of your hand, pull out and discard the stones, then roughly chop them and add them to the bowl.</li><li>Trim and finely slice the spring onions and add them to the bowl.</li><li>Add the balsamic vinegar and 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.</li><li>Squeeze in the juice of ½ a lemon, using your fingers to catch any pips.</li><li>Sprinkle over a pinch of black pepper.</li><li>Pick and tear over the mint leaves, toss everything together, then serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Pick the basil leaves onto a chopping board (reserving a few baby leaves to garnish), then roughly chop the remaining leaves and finely chop the stalks.</li><li>Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic. If using fresh, cut the tomatoes in half, then roughly chop them or carefully open the tins of tomatoes.</li><li>Put a saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the onion, then cook for around 7 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden.</li><li>Stir in the garlic and basil stalks for a few minutes, then add the fresh or tinned tomatoes and the vinegar.</li><li>Season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, then continue cooking for around 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Stir in the chopped basil leaves, then reduce to low and leave to tick away. Meanwhile…</li><li>Carefully fill a large pot three-quarters of the way up with boiling water, add a tiny pinch of salt and bring back to the boil.</li><li>Add the spaghetti and cook according to packet instructions – you want to cook your pasta until it is al dente. This translates as ‘to the tooth’ and means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of a bite and firmness to it. Use the timings on the packet instructions as a guide, but try some just before the time is up to make sure it’s perfectly cooked.</li><li>Once the pasta is done, ladle out and reserve a cup of the cooking water and keep it to one side, then drain in a colander over the sink and tip the spaghetti back into the pot.</li><li>Stir the spaghetti into the sauce, adding a splash of the pasta water to loosen, if needed.</li><li>Serve with the reserved basil leaves sprinkled over the top and use a microplane to finely grate the Parmesan cheese, then sprinkle over.</li><li>PRINT THIS RECIPE <a href="http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/foodrevolution/pdf/classic-tomato-spaghetti-fr-uk.pdf">(UK)</a><br/>

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Fill a large pan with water, add a tiny pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat.</li><li>Meanwhile, on a chopping board, cut the florets from the broccoli, then cut or break them into bite-sized pieces.</li><li>Trim and cut the stalk in half, then finely slice it.</li><li>Once boiling, use a slotted spoon to carefully lower the broccoli into the water.</li><li>Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender – you should be able to poke the tip of a knife easily into the florets.</li><li>Drain over the sink into a colander, then leave to steam dry for a minute.</li><li>Tip back into the pan, then sprinkle with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.</li><li>Add the butter and toss to coat, then tip into a serving bowl and serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To make the puris, place the semolina, flour and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then gradually add the soda water, stirring continuously until the mixture comes together to form a stiff dough. Place into a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to stand for 30 minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile, blitz all the pani ingredients, ½ a bunch of coriander, a pinch of salt and pepper and 200ml of water in a liquidiser until smooth. Line a sieve with a double layer of muslin, place over a large bowl, then pour in the tomato mixture and leave to strain – you’ll end up with a beautiful, intense, flavoured water.</li><li>Meanwhile, make the green salsa. Roughly chop and add the ginger to a liquidiser with the remaining salsa ingredients. Blitz until smooth, then season to taste and transfer to a small bowl. </li><li>For the spiced chickpeas, heat a lug of olive oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. Add the cumin, curry leaves and cinnamon, then fry for around 3 minutes, or until nicely toasted. Stir in the chickpeas, then add the tamarind paste or chutney and cook for a further 3 minutes to warm through, shaking the pan occasionally. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</li><li>Shape the puri dough on a flour-dusted surface into a long sausage shape, roughly 40cm in length, then take small lumps of dough and roll into rough grape-sized pieces with your hands. Roll the dough out into thin, flat circles, roughly 7cm in diameter.</li><li>Place a large, deep pan over a high heat, add the vegetable oil and allow it to get really hot. To test if it’s hot enough, drop a tiny piece of dough into the pan – if it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, it’s about right. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower 3 to 4 dough circles into the pan. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffed up, using the spoon to push them under the oil, then carefully flip them over and continue cooking for 2 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining dough. </li><li>Meanwhile, finely chop the fennel, radishes, onion and cucumber, then place into separate bowls. </li><li>To serve the puris, smash a hole in the top and spoon some chickpeas, green salsa and chopped vegetables inside. Drizzle in a little of the pani, pick over a few of the remaining coriander leaves and tuck in.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.</li><li>Just cover the porcini with boiling water, then set aside to rehydrate.</li><li>Peel and finely slice the onions and garlic, then place in a large pan over a medium-low heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Strip in the rosemary and sage leaves and add 1 teaspoon of dried oregano.</li><li>Roughly chop the porcini (reserving the soaking liquor) and add to the pan, then fry for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to high, then add the wine and let it bubble and cook away.</li><li>Stir in the chickpeas (juice and all), lentils and 2 bay leaves. Scrunch in the tomatoes through your clean hands, then pour in the porcini soaking liquor (discarding just the last gritty bit). </li><li>Season with sea salt and black pepper, bring to the boil, then simmer on a low heat for 1 hour, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Trim the aubergines and peel with a speed-peeler, leaving a little of the skin to create a stripy effect, then slice into 1cm-thick rounds. Place in a colander, sprinkle with a good pinch of salt and leave in the sink to drain (the salt will draw out the moisture).</li><li>Peel the potatoes and slice into rough 1cm rounds, then parboil in a pan of boiling salted water for 5 minutes. Drain and leave to steam dry, then place in a large, deep roasting tray (30cm x 40cm).</li><li>Season, drizzle with oil and scatter over 1 heaped tablespoon of dried oregano. Toss well to coat, then roast in a single layer for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and tender.</li><li>Meanwhile, rinse the aubergines and pat dry with kitchen paper, then spread out across a few large roasting trays. </li><li>Drizzle with oil, season with pepper and oregano, then roast alongside the potatoes for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.</li><li>Warm the milk with the remaining 2 bay leaves and the peppercorns in a pan on a medium-low heat – keep an eye on it. Before it boils, strain into a jug, then wipe out the pan and return to a medium heat.</li><li>Melt the butter, then stir in the flour to form a paste. Start adding the hot milk, a splash at a time, stirring in each addition before adding more, until you have a smooth, creamy sauce.</li><li>Crumble in one-third of the feta and grate in one-third of the kefalotyri, then simmer over a low heat for a further 5 minutes, or until thick and smooth. Leave to cool slightly.</li><li>To assemble, spoon half the ragù over the tray of potatoes, then layer half the aubergines on top. Repeat with the remaining ragù and aubergines.</li><li>Separate the eggs (saving the whites for another recipe). Whisk the yolks into the sauce, then pour over the aubergines. Crumble and grate over the remaining cheese, drizzle with oil, and bake for 40 minutes, or until golden.</li><li>Leave to stand for 30 minutes, then serve. Great with a Greek salad.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Melt the 100g of butter and leave it to cool.</li><li>Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk and whisk to combine. Add the cooled melted butter and gradually stir it through the mixture. It’s important not to stir the mixture any more after this or your waffles may be tough.</li><li>Place your griddle pan over a high heat, add the extra teaspoon of butter and as soon as it’s melted pour in the waffle batter and spread it around to fill the pan. You could also make smaller waffles, if you prefer – you’ll need to do 2 at a time.</li><li>Lower the heat to medium-low and cook the waffles for around 6 minutes, or until lightly golden on the bottom. Flip over and continue to cook for around 6 minutes, until golden and cooked through. (It can be tricky to flip a whole waffle, but be bold and go for it – if it breaks, don’t worry, you can rock the rustic look.)</li><li>Give the waffle an extra couple of minutes on each side to crisp up, then serve them with your toppings. I like mine with bacon, egg and maple syrup, but you can serve them with berries and yoghurt, or whatever you like.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To make the pangritata, lightly toast the sourdough. Peel the garlic, then put in a food processor with the toasted bread and the walnuts. Pick in the leaves of the herbs and blitz until fine. </li><li>Preheat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, add a drizzle of olive oil, then add the pangritata and fry for around 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp.</li><li>Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and place a large heatproof bowl on top. Add the mascarpone or crème fraîche to the bowl along with the leftover cheeses, crumbling or grating any harder varieties first, then stir until melted. </li><li>Carefully remove the bowl from the heat and set aside, then turn the heat up to high. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and cook according to packet instructions. </li><li>Drain the pasta, reserving a cupful of cooking water, then add to the bowl of melted cheese and toss to coat, adding a splash of the reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed.</li><li>Transfer to a serving platter, drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil, sprinkle the crispy pangritata on top and serve right away.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Put 6 wooden skewers into a tray of cold water to soak – this will stop them from burning.</li><li>On a chopping board, cut the halloumi into 2cm cubes, then add to a large mixing bowl.</li><li>Carefully cut the pepper in half from top to bottom, then trim away the stalk, seeds and any white pith (you can use teaspoon to do this), then slice into 2cm pieces and add to the bowl.</li><li>Cut the courgette in half lengthways, then cut into half-moon slices, roughly ½cm thick, then add to the bowl along with the tomatoes.</li><li>Pick the mint leaves onto a board and finely chop them, discarding the stalks.</li><li>Carefully deseed and finely chop the chilli, if using.</li><li>Use a microplane to finely grate the lemon zest onto a board, then add to the bowl along with the mint leaves, chilli (if using), and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.</li><li>Season with a pinch of pepper, then mix well to coat.</li><li>Preheat the grill to high.</li><li>Lightly grease a baking tray with oil, then put aside.</li><li>Thread and divide the halloumi cubes, cherry tomatoes, pepper and courgette pieces between the skewers.</li><li>Place onto the greased tray and cook under the grill for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and the veg are soft, turning halfway through.</li><li>Serve with a fresh green salad and some flatbreads or pittas.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Soak the corn (husks and all) in cold water for at least 30 minutes – if you can’t find cobs with the husks intact, you don’t need to do this. Meanwhile, place the mayo into a bowl with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the zest from the limes and the juice from 1. Mix well, taste and add a squeeze more juice, if needed. Spread the mayo onto a plate, then dust with the paprika or cayenne pepper and put to one side. Grate the cheese onto another large plate, then set aside also.</li><li>Preheat a griddle pan over a high heat. Add the corn and griddle for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the husks are black and charred all over, turning occasionally – the husks will help to steam the corn until tender.</li><li>Peel back the husks, keeping them intact at the base, then roll each cob into the lime-spiked mayo, before rolling into the cheese. Shake off any excess and get stuck in.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>You won’t believe how tasty the courgettes get with this method of cooking – it really does take them to another level. You’ve got to find some Lincolnshire Poacher, it’s an amazing cheese made by the very talented Jones brothers, Simon and Tim. The pastry is rich and amazing, so embrace the fact that it’s really crumbly and will definitely break as you’re making it. I’m serving this with a lemony salad and sweet salt-baked shallots, which will get caramelized and gorgeous and pick up the seasoning from the bed of salt. This method is also a great one for beetroots, so if you like this, try that.</i></li><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Blitz the flour and butter in a food processor with a pinch of salt and a few good pinches of pepper until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Tip on to a work surface, make a well in the centre and add 100ml of cold water. Gently mix until it starts to come together, then – most importantly for a short, crumbly pastry – have the confidence to only just press, pat and almost hug it together to form a rough scruffy ball. Please don’t be tempted to knead the dough or it won’t be short and crumbly. Pop it into a floured bowl, cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge to chill while you make the filling.</li><li>Put a drizzle of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and pick in the leaves from half the bunch of thyme. Add a few gratings of nutmeg, the zest of half the lemon, the sliced courgettes and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Cook gently (the courgettes will cook down and become easier to handle), stirring occasionally, for around 25 minutes. Then turn the heat down to low and cook for another 20 minutes, so the courgette mixture becomes dense and the flavours really intensify and sweeten. Allow to cool a little, finely chop and crumble in the cheese, then chop and add the mint leaves. Set aside.</li><li>Halve the pastry and roll each half into a circle just under 1cm thick and slightly larger than the pie dish you’ve chosen (roughly 23cm diameter x 4cm deep). Don’t worry if the pastry breaks up – that’s normal. Just patch it. Roll one of the circles around the rolling pin and carefully unroll it over the pie dish. Gently press the pastry into the corners and sides of the dish, then spoon and spread all your courgette mixture into the dish. Carefully unroll the pastry lid over the top, then flour your thumb and forefinger and gently pinch and crimp the edges together. Trim off any excess pastry and brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg.</li><li>Now simply throw the rock salt into a roasting tray with the shallots, still with their skins on, and a few thyme tips. Put the pie right at the bottom of the oven, with the tray of shallots above. Cook for 1 hour, or until the pie is golden, then allow to cool and serve with those soft roasted shallots.</li><li>PS: All the leftover salt from baking the shallots can be bashed up and reused.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Add all the flatbread ingredients to a mixing bowl and mix together with a spoon, then use clean hands to pat and bring everything together. </li><li>Dust a clean work surface with flour, then tip out the dough.</li><li>Knead for a minute or so to bring it all together (this isn’t a traditional bread recipe, so you don’t need to knead it for long – just enough time to bring everything together). </li><li>Put the dough into a floured-dusted bowl and cover with a plate, then leave aside.</li><li>If making the garlic butter: peel the garlic cloves and crush them with a garlic crusher. </li><li>Pick the herb leaves onto a chopping board and finely chop them, discarding the stalks. </li><li>Melt the butter in a small pan over a medium heat, then stir through the garlic and chopped herbs, then set aside.</li><li>Dust a clean work surface and rolling pin with flour, then divide the dough in half, then divide each half into 6 equal-sized pieces (roughly the size of a golf ball). </li><li>With your hands, pat and flatten the dough, then use a rolling pin to roll each piece into 12cm rounds, roughly 2mm to 3mm thick. </li><li>Use a knife to cut 6 lines into the centre of each round, leaving about 3cm at each end.</li><li>Place the griddle pan on a high heat, then once hot, cook each one for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until bar-marked and puffed up, turning with tongs. </li><li>Brush the flatbreads all over with herby garlic butter as they come off the griddle, then pile onto a serving board so everyone can dig in and help themselves.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl. </li><li>Add the milk and season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper. </li><li>Gently whisk the eggs and milk together with a fork, then put to one side.</li><li>Place the frying pan on a medium heat to heat up. Meanwhile…</li><li>Dip and push 1 slice of bread into the eggy mixture, turning it over a few times to make sure it’s well coated and sucks up the mixture like a sponge. </li><li>Add ½ a tablespoon of olive oil to the frying pan and carefully swirl the pan around to evenly coat the inside. </li><li>Lift the soaked bread up in the bowl and allow the excess mixture to drip off, then carefully lower it into the pan, making sure it’s facing away from you so you don’t get splashed with hot oil.</li><li>Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through, using a fish slice to flip it over. </li><li>Carefully lift the bread out of the frying pan and onto a serving plate using a fish slice. </li><li>Place the pan back on the heat and repeat steps 6 to 10 with the remaining ingredients.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Crack the eggs into a measuring jug. </li><li>Add a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then use a fork to beat them together well. </li><li>Put a medium saucepan over a low heat and add the butter. </li><li>Leave it to melt slowly, then when it starts to bubble carefully pour in the eggs. </li><li>Stir slowly with a wooden spoon, or a spatula if you’ve got one, so you can get right to the edges of the pan. </li><li>Keep gently stirring until the eggs still look silky, slightly runny and slightly underdone, and then remove from the heat – the heat of the pan will continue to cook the eggs to perfection. </li><li>Serve with lightly buttered toast.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. </li><li>Wash the potatoes under cold running water, scrubbing well with a scrubber to get rid of any dirt (there’s no need to peel them).</li><li>On a chopping board, cut each potato in half lengthways, then cut each half in half lengthways, and then each piece in half again so you end up with 8 wedges, then add to a large mixing bowl. </li><li>Sprinkle over a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and the paprika. </li><li>Drizzle over 2 tablespoons olive oil, then toss everything together to coat.</li><li>Spread out into a single layer over two large baking trays, then bake in the hot oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. </li><li>Use oven gloves to remove the trays from the oven, then leave to sit for a couple of minutes (this will make it easier to remove them from the tray), then use a fish slice to transfer them to a serving dish.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Lightly rub a baking tray with some olive oil and put to one side. </li><li>Put a large pan on a low heat and add your butter and sugar. Leave on a gentle simmer for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally to stop it catching, until the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture starts to darken. </li><li>Gently stir in your pecans until they’re well coated in the caramel syrup. Be careful not to splash yourself, and don’t be tempted to have a taste because hot caramel can burn quite badly. </li><li>Once coated, tip the nuts on to the oiled tray and use the back of a spoon to separate them out into one layer. Leave them to cool so the caramel can harden on the nuts.</li><li>Meanwhile, make your dressing. Grate the orange zest into a large salad bowl, squeeze in the juice and add the Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar and a good lug of extra virgin olive oil. Whisk them, then have a taste – you want to get a nice balance between the sharpness of the vinegar and the smoothness of the oil, so add a little more oil if needed, then season carefully with sea salt and black pepper.</li><li>Click off the chicory leaves and wash and spin dry all your leaves. Core, quarter and finely slice your apples and add to the bowl with all your leaves. </li><li>Break the cooled pecans apart, add half of them to the bowl, and use your hands to delicately toss and dress everything. </li><li>Serve on one big platter, or divide up between plates, and finish by crumbling over the rest of your beautiful caramel pecans.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>Crumpies are my new delicious invention and are a cross between a crumpet and a Yorkshire pudding. They can be whizzed together quickly, then poured into a Yorkshire pudding mould and banged into the oven to get lovely and crisp on the top and bottom, and knotty, chewy and bubbly inside. They’re perfect with butter, or whatever other lovely condiments you’ve got hanging around the cupboard. My wife loves strawberry jam with hers, Daisy loves Marmite, Poppy loves a drizzle of honey, and personally I like a little scrambled egg with a blob of ketchup or brown sauce (or both) on the plate and, depending on how I feel, a little chilli sauce.</i></li><li>Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3 and grease a 12-hole muffin tin with some vegetable oil. Place all the other ingredients in a bowl with 2 teaspoons of sea salt and pour in 600ml of tepid water. The water needs to be warm enough to activate the yeast, but not so hot that it kills it. </li><li>Whisk everything together until you’ve got a loose batter that is just combined – this should only take a few seconds. Leave to stand for 10 minutes to let the yeast do its job. When the mixture is a spoonable, sticky consistency, but still quite wet, spoon it into the muffin tin. Fill each hole until it’s almost level with the top of the tin and cook for around 35 minutes, or until the crumpies are risen and golden. Remove to a wire rack for a few minutes to cool slightly, then serve while still warm with anything you fancy.</li><li>Here are a few ideas to get your started:</li><li>Cream cheese<br/>
Jam and banana<br/>
A few slices of cooked ham<br/>
Some beautiful slices of cheese<br/>
Smoked salmon and a wedge of lemon<br/>
Sliced strawberries with cream or yoghurt<br/>
Some snapped up pieces of crispy bacon<br/>
A spoonful of quality jam<br/>
Sliced banana and runny honey<br/>
A spoonful of nutella<br/>
Ham and mustard<br/>
A poached egg<br/>

You can pop them into the oven at 180°C/350°F/gas 4 for a few minutes, microwave them for a few seconds or even lay them over the lid of the pan so they heat up as the eggs cook.</li><li>Take the lid off and check your eggs by giving them a poke with your finger. When they’re done to your liking, turn the heat off and take the pan to the table with the warmed tortillas, the Cheddar and a grater so everyone can get involved and make their own. Personally, I like to grate a bit of cheese right on to a warm tortilla, spoon an egg and some of the wonderful tomato stew on top, wrap it up, and eat it right away. What a beautiful way to wake up!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>This is one of the most delicious cornbreads I’ve ever had. You get incredible flavour from the onions and sweetcorn, while the cornmeal gives it a rustic, spongy texture that’s so brilliant. Two of my favourites, chilli and cheese, do their thing in this bread and really take the flavour to a whole other level. You can serve this cornbread alongside soups or stews, but frankly, I think a good slice of this, with a bit of crunchy salad, makes a brilliant lunch. You could also reheat it in a dry pan the next day for breakfast and eat it with poached eggs and some smoky bacon . . . totally delicious.</i></li><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Grease a 22cm cake tin with oil and line the base with greaseproof paper.</li><li>Peel and finely slice the onions.

For a lovely creamy finish, try crumbling in and stirring through a cooked Jersey Royal. Serve with grilled meat or fish, or simply stirred through pasta – delicious!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. Add the potatoes to a medium pan of boiling salted water, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain and leave to steam dry, then place in medium roasting tray and mash lightly with a potato masher. </li><li>Throw in the garlic and rosemary, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a good lug of olive oil. Place in the hot oven for around 40 minutes, or until crispy and golden. Delicious served with Spring lamb and asparagus.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Put the flour, yeast and 1 tablespoon of salt in a large bowl. Stir to combine and make a well in the middle. Gradually pour 650ml of lukewarm water into the well, continuously stirring and bringing in the flour as you go to form a rough dough. </li><li>Transfer the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead for around 10 minutes, or until smooth and springy. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for around 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li><li>Meanwhile, lightly grease a large baking tray. Once the dough has risen, knock it back with your fist and place on the oiled baking tray. Using your hands, spread it out to cover the tray, then drizzle with olive oil. Use your fingers to push down into the dough to make lots of little wells and dips. </li><li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Add the Jersey Royals to a medium pan of boiling salted water, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain and leave to cool in a colander. Meanwhile, finely slice the purple potatoes with a mandolin (use the guard!) and add to a bowl with the rosemary leaves. </li><li>Separate and lightly crush the garlic cloves, then add to the bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and toss to combine. Evenly spread the potato mixture over the dough, crumble over the cooled Jersey Royals, drizzle with a little more olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cover with a tea towel and leave in a warm place for another hour, or until doubled in size.</li><li>Once risen, use your fingers to push down into the dough again to make lots of little wells and dips. Place in the hot oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Leave to cool slightly, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Very finely slice the cedro with a mandolin (use the guard!) and place in a large bowl along with the juice of the lemon. Add the mint, rocket and chilli, followed by a good lug of extra virgin olive oil and put to one side.</li><li>Place a griddle pan over a high heat and toast the soughdough for around 3 to 4 minutes, or until nicely bar-marked and golden, turning halfway. Using tongs, remove the toasted sourdough to a serving board, then halve the garlic clove and rub all over one side of the bread. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil, halve the tomatoes and rub into the bread, then tear over the mozzarella.</li><li>Season the cedro salad to taste, then toss well to combine and pile onto the bruschetta. Serve right away.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Heat the stock. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Trim and finely chop the celery.</li><li>Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the knob of butter into a separate pan, add the onion, garlic and celery, and cook very slowly for about 15 minutes without colouring. This is called a soffrito. When the vegetables have softened, add the rice and turn up the heat.</li><li>The rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. After a minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring – it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence.</li><li>Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of sea salt. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take around 15 minutes. </li><li>Taste the rice to check if it’s cooked. If not, carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don’t forget to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water.</li><li>Remove from the heat and add the 70g butter and grate in the Parmesan. Stir well. Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes. This is the most important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes amazingly creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as possible, while it retains its beautiful texture.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Fill a large pan with cold water, add a good pinch of sea salt and put it on a high heat. Peel 1 large swede (roughly 1kg), and cut it into 2cm chunks. Once the water is boiling, add the swede and cook for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, peel 1kg of potatoes and cut them into 2.5cm chunks. When the 15 minutes is up, add the potatoes and cook for a further 10 to 15 minutes, or until everything is soft and cooked through. Drain, leave to steam dry for a minute, then mash with a good pinch of salt and white pepper and a knob of butter.</li></ol>]

Pour all the rice and barley into a deep saucepan with the bulb of garlic and the herb stalks and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 20 minutes. If using farro cook for 30 minutes before adding the rice, as it needs around 50 minutes in total. Check the grains are soft to the bite then cook for 1 minute more. Drain through a sieve, saving the cooking water. </li><li>Keep the grains in the sieve and place it over the saucepan containing the cooking water. Cover with a lid and place back on the heat so the grains steam for about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and tip the grains into a bowl to cool down. </li><li>Pick out and discard the herb stalks, then pick out the garlic bulb and squeeze all the cloves so the garlic inside goes into a bowl. Lightly mash the garlic with the back of a fork. Chop the herb leaves and stir these into the garlic. Season well with salt, pepper, plenty of extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice. Stir this dressing through the cooled grains. Give it a taste and adjust the seasoning if you need to. </li><li>Heat a splash of olive oil in a frying pan and add the fennel and cumin seeds and the oats. Stir and fry for a few minutes until the seeds start smelling fantastic and the oats are lightly toasted. </li><li>Spoon the grain mixture into a serving dish, stirring through half of the spiced, toasted oats and sprinkling the rest over the top.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. </li><li>Bring the stock to a simmer in a saucepan and keep warm. In a separate large pan, add a splash of olive oil, the onion and celery, and cook gently for about 15 minutes until softened. </li><li>Add the rice and turn up the heat a bit. Keep stirring to stop it catching. After a minute or two, pour in the vermouth or wine and stir constantly until the alcohol has evaporated, leaving the rice with a lovely perfume. </li><li>Turn down the heat and add a ladleful of warm stock. Keep stirring until the rice has fully absorbed the stock, then add another ladleful. Continue to add the stock, one ladleful at a time, until it’s all absorbed. This should take about 15 minutes and give you rice that is beginning to soften but is still al dente. </li><li>Meanwhile, pop the goat’s cheese onto a roasting tray, sprinkle over the fennel seeds and red chilli, and place in the oven for 10 minutes. </li><li>Next, heat a deep saucepan on a medium heat, then add 1 tablespoon of butter, a splash of olive oil, the garlic and a good grating of nutmeg. </li><li>Once the butter has melted, add the sorrel and cook for about 2 minutes, moving it around until it’s just wilted down. Take the pan off the heat, let the sorrel cool slightly, then chop it finely and season to taste. </li><li>Take the pan of rice off the heat, add the chopped sorrel and beat in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan. Add a good squeeze of lemon juice, then check the seasoning and add a little salt and pepper if needed. </li><li>Pop a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute, while you remove the goat’s cheese from the oven. </li><li>Dish up your risotto, grate a little lemon zest over the top, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, and top with another grating of Parmesan. Serve with the lovely roasted goat’s cheese on the side for everyone to crumble over the top.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Pop the bread on a hot griddle pan and toast it on both sides. </li><li>Roughly mash the leftover vegetables. Season with sea salt and black pepper, drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil and a little splash of balsamic, then mash again. </li><li>Halve the garlic clove, then rub the cut-sides all over the toast, then spoon the mashed vegetables on top. </li><li>Pick and roughly chop the parsley leaves, then scatter on top. </li><li>Pick the mint leaves, then toss with the salad leaves, a good pinch of salt, a splash of extra virgin olive oil, a drizzle of balsamic and a squeeze of lemon juice. </li><li>Put a pinch of salad leaves on top of the bruschetta, then shave over some Parmesan. Finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and serve right away with the rest of the salad on the side.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>The bread is best sliced 1cm thick and toasted on a barbecue, but it can also be done in a griddle pan for ease at home. After that it should be lightly rubbed a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic, then drizzled with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper. The toppings can be as humble or as luxurious as you like, from chopped herbs or a squashed tomato with basil, to marinated vegetables or beautiful cheeses, to lovely flaked crabmeat. The only rule is that whatever goes on top of a bruschetta should be nice and fresh and cooked with care.</li><li>Make sure your tomatoes are really ripe when making this topping. Give them a wash, remove their cores and carefully squeeze out the seeds. Place in a bowl, tear in the basil, season with salt and pepper, then toss with a good glug of olive oil and a good swig of vinegar to balance the flavours to your taste. You can serve the tomatoes either chunky or finely chopped, or you can scrunch them between your fingers before putting them on your basic bruschette – really tasty.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>This salad with radicchio is one of my favourite winter salads – the crispness of the bread, the saltiness of the feta cheese. It comes with quite a sweet dressing which compliments the bitterness of the leaves perfectly. </i></li><li>A great little starter. You don’t need to buy expensive balsamic vinegar for this one – the cheap stuff is fine as you’ll be reducing it into a lovely dressing.</li><li>Cut the radicchio into quarters. Grill in a dry, very hot griddle pan until nicely charred on all sides. Remove to a large bowl and griddle the slices of bread. </li><li>To make the warm dressing, fry the sliced garlic, pine nuts and raisins in a little olive oil. When the garlic starts to colour, take the pan off the heat and pour in the balsamic vinegar. Most of the liquid will evaporate when it hits the hot pan, so you end up with a sticky dressing. Leave to cool a little. </li><li>Roughly tear up the grilled radicchio and bread, and place back in the large bowl. Toss with the dressing, then squeeze out the dressing. Divide the radicchio and bread over your plates. Top with the rocket leaves, any pine nuts and raisins left in the bowl, and crumble the feta over the top.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To make the basil oil, pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks. Put a few leaves in a bowl of cold water for later, then place the rest in a pestle and mortar. Add a pinch of sea salt and bash the basil leaves until they have broken down into a dark green paste. Transfer the paste to a jug and add your extra virgin olive oil. Mix together well. </li><li>To make the soup, add a lug of olive oil to your biggest pan over a medium heat. Peel and slice the garlic and add to the pan with the basil stalks. Fry for about a minute then add all the tomatoes. Stir in 150ml of water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a medium heat and let the tomatoes cook for 5 minutes until they are slightly broken down. If your tomatoes are nice and ripe they’ll be naturally sweet and soft, which means you won’t need to cook the soup for too long. </li><li>Remove the soup from the heat, add a splash of red wine vinegar then carefully blitz with a hand blender until you get a consistency that’s to your liking. </li><li>Serve in warm bowls with a spoonful of bright green basil oil swirled on top and sprinkled with the reserved basil leaves. You can even eat any leftovers cold from the fridge for a really fresh, light soup.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place the flours and ½ a tablespoon of sea salt into a large bowl, and make a well in the middle. Add the yeast and sugar to the lukewarm water, and mix with a fork. Leave this for a few minutes and, when it starts to foam, slowly pour it into the well, mixing with a fork as you go. </li><li>As soon as all the ingredients come together, which may take a minute or so, knead vigorously for around 5 minutes until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough. </li><li>Lightly oil a large bowl with some olive oil and transfer the dough to the bowl. Dust with a little extra flour, cover with a tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for 30 minutes until doubled in size. </li><li>While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7 and prepare the toppings. </li><li>For the balsamic onion topping, finely slice the onions and pick the thyme leaves. Fry the onions and thyme in 2 tablespoons of olive oil over a low heat for about 5 minutes. Add 6 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, reduce for a minute or two, then leave to cool. </li><li>For the basil and cherry tomato topping, pick and roughly chop the basil leaves and halve the tomatoes. Pop the basil and tomatoes into a bowl and season with sea salt and black pepper, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a tiny splash of white wine vinegar. Peel and slice the garlic and mix into the bowl. </li><li>To cook the focaccia, as soon as the dough has risen, pound it, then place on a baking tray and spread it out to cover the tray. Push down roughly on top of the dough like a piano to make lots of rough dips and wells. </li><li>Divide the onion and the tomato toppings over two thirds of the focaccia.</li><li>For the three-cheese and rosemary topping, break up the Taleggio and the goat’s cheese over the remaining third of the focaccia. Grate a handful of Parmesan cheese and pick the rosemary leaves. Sprinkle both over the final third and season with pepper. Finish with a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt. </li><li>Leave to prove for a further 20 minutes, then bake for 20 minutes, until golden on top and soft in the middle.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>As kids love pasta and tomato sauce, this is an easy way to encourage them to try asparagus. Like the ‘full of veg’ tomato sauce you can always whiz the asparagus in a blender if you think they’ll be suspicious of the green bits. </i></li><li>The tomato does a good job of mellowing the flavour of the asparagus and once they’re used to eating it there are loads of wonderful dishes you can introduce them to.</li><li>Heat a saucepan over a medium heat and add a nice lug of olive oil. Add the garlic and fry until it turns a light golden brown. Add the chopped basil stalks and tinned tomatoes, and bring to the boil. Season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt, then simmer for 5 minutes. </li><li>Snap the woody ends off the asparagus stalks and throw them away. You can either chop the asparagus finely with a knife or use a food processor. Add it to the tomato sauce, let it simmer for 1 minute or so, then take it off the heat. Taste, and add a little salt and pepper if needed. Finish off the sauce by stirring in the basil leaves. </li><li>Cook the tagliatelle according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Toss in the pasta sauce with a little of the water to loosen. Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and plenty of Parmesan cheese.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>These gorgeous deep-fried mushrooms have the most unbelievable texture and make a brilliant starter or, even better, a simple snack. In fact, they’re so delicious I end up eating them as soon as they come out of the pan, so not all of them make it to the table! You can use one type of mushroom – like I’ve done here with the field mushrooms – or a mixture. Tearing them up into different sizes will add a wonderful mixture of textures, colours and flavours.</i></li><li>Start by making your posh, flavoured vinegar. Put the whole sprigs of tarragon and thyme, the peppercorns and garlic slices into a bottle, then top with the vinegar, making sure it completely covers all the herbs and spices. Allow the vinegar to steep for at least a few hours and, remember, the longer you leave it, the more delicious it will become. You can let it infuse for a couple of weeks to really push up the flavour and, as long as you strain the vinegar after this time and bottle it up, you can keep using it for a good few months. </li><li>Fill a deep pan with the olive oil and let it heat up over a medium heat. Meanwhile, put the flour on a large plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and the lemon zest. Cut or tear the mushrooms into uneven chunks, and sprinkle them with a bit of water to moisten them. Toss handfuls of the mushrooms in the seasoned flour until they are all lightly coated. </li><li>To test if the oil is hot enough, add a small piece of potato to the pan. Once it begins to sizzle and brown, the oil is ready. Deep-fry the mushrooms in batches – about a handful at a time - until they’re golden brown. The cooking time will depend on the size of the mushrooms but it shouldn’t take more than 3 or 4 minutes – just use your instincts. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and leave on kitchen paper to drain for a minute. Serve as soon as possible sprinkled with a pinch of salt, some posh vinegar and some roughly chopped parsley. Delicious!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place all the crumpet ingredients into a food processor, add 2 teaspoons of sea salt and 600ml of tepid water and blitz to a loose batter.</li><li>Leave to stand for 10 minutes to let the yeast develop – the mixture should be quite wet, just about dropping consistency.</li><li>Meanwhile, make the topping. Finely grate the lemon zest into a bowl, add ricotta and honey, then beat together until light and fluffy. </li><li>Mash half the raspberries with a fork and ripple through the ricotta.</li><li>Grease the inside of the metal rings with oil, then place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat – work in batches, according to the number of metal rings you have. </li><li>When the pan’s nice and hot, spoon some mixture into each ring, so it’s roughly 1cm deep. Turn the heat down to low and leave for 15 minutes to cook through – keep an eye on them and reduce the heat slightly, if you think the bottoms are getting too dark. </li><li>When the time’s up, bubbles and crumpet-like dimples should have formed on the top — turn the crumpets over, using tongs to lift the rings away. Cook for another 5 to 10 minutes, or perfectly golden.</li><li>Serve the crumpets warm with a generous spoonful of ricotta, a scattering of fresh raspberries and an extra drizzle of honey, if you like.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>This crunchy radish pickle makes a lovely, fresh friend for your favourite curry</i></li><li>Finely slice the large radishes – a speed peeler is ideal for this. For the smaller radishes, you can just top and tail them and then slice into quarters. </li><li>To make your dressing, lightly toast your cumin and then bash up in a pestle and mortar with the small dried chilli and your grated ginger. Add in the lime juice and oil, season with salt and pepper, and then give it all a good stir. Put your radishes into a bowl with the coriander leaves, and lightly toss together with the dressing (you can make this up to 2 hours in advance).</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Heat a stainless-steel saucepan and add a splash of vegetable oil. Fry the garlic until light brown, add the cumin seeds, the tomatoes, the tamarind paste, the mango chunks, the apricots and the brown sugar. Turn the heat down and simmer gently for about 15 minutes or so, or until the chutney reduces and thickens slightly. </li><li>Taste and season with more salt, sugar or lime juice if necessary, and put to one side to cool. Add a little grated lime zest before serving.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>This is based on the Italian classic mostarda, which is fruit pickled in mustard syrup.

Whiz the lime leaves, if using, 3 of the chillies, the garlic, ginger, lemongrass, coriander stalks, Chinese five spice and cumin to a dryish paste in a food processor. Discard the stringy bits, if any. </li><li>Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add the spice paste and onion and cook gently for about 10 minutes, stirring to release the flavours. Add the squash and stock, and stir around, scraping all the goodness off the bottom of the pan. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, with the lid on, for about 15 minutes, until the squash is soft and cooked. </li><li>Pour in the rice and give it a really good stir – the squash might begin to break up, but it doesn’t matter. Continue to simmer, covered, for 12 minutes, until the rice is just cooked. </li><li>Add the coconut milk, stir again, taste and season carefully. Bring back to a simmer, then add the lime juice, to taste. Spoon into tea or coffee cups and decorate with the fresh coriander leaves, the remaining sliced chilli and some shaved fresh coconut, if using.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. </li><li>Pulse the flour and butter in a food processor until they start to look like breadcrumbs. Tip into a bowl and make a well in the middle. </li><li>In another bowl, beat the eggs and milk with a fork, add a good pinch of salt and pepper and pour into the well. Mix the flour into the eggs and milk, adding a little more milk if needed, until you have a soft, dry dough. </li><li>Split the dough evenly into 3 pieces. Press each piece out flat on your work surface and sprinkle 1 piece with mustard powder, 1 with cumin powder and the last with grated cheese. Roll up each piece and knead lightly until the flavouring is just mixed in, trying not to handle the mixture too much. </li><li>Press or roll the dough pieces flat again, until they are about 2.5cm thick. Cut out 2 circles from each piece with an 8cm cutter or the rim of a glass, and place upside down on a baking sheet. Brush the top of each scone with the extra milk and bake in the oven for 15 minutes, until risen and brown.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Gently boil the potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain and leave to cool slightly. </li><li>Whisk the mustard with the vinegar and slowly add the olive oil. Add the chopped shallots and parsley and season well with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Slice the cooked potatoes in half and dress with the shallot and parsley vinaigrette.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Gently boil the potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain well and leave to cool slightly. </li><li>Make the mayonnaise by whisking together the egg yolk and English mustard in a bowl. Then add the olive oil very gradually, drop by drop – once you’ve blended in a quarter of the oil, add the rest a little more quickly, whisking all the time. Pound the garlic with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar and add to the mayonnaise. Season with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. </li><li>Slice the cooked potatoes in half and dress with the garlic mayonnaise. Turn the cress punnets on their sides and slice the cress stalks near the base. If the cress is a bit dirty, give it a good wash before folding into the dressed potatoes. Then tuck in and enjoy!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Bring a pot of salted water to the boil and add your cauliflower. Bring back to the boil for 1 minute, then remove the florets with a slotted spoon and leave in a colander. Keep the cauliflower water to one side. </li><li>Heat a wide pan big enough to hold all the ingredients at once. Add a good splash of vegetable oil and when it’s hot, add the mustard seeds, the asafoetida, the curry leaves and turmeric. Fry for a few seconds then add the diced potatoes, just enough of the cauliflower water to cover them and some salt. Cover with a lid and simmer gently until the potatoes are just cooked. Add the peas, chillies and cauliflower florets, stir and replace the lid. Cook over a gentle heat until everything is cooked and soft, and the liquid has reduced.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>Egg pasta and pesto together is a piece of cooking genius really, and just about the only successful tweak you can make is to add a few green beans and some very thinly sliced potato – like they often do in Genoa.</i></li><li>If you haven’t had it before, try it – you’ll like it, and it’s really quick and easy.</li><li>Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Meanwhile, crush the pine nuts in a pestle and mortar with the garlic. Scoop out, put to one side, then put the basil in the mortar with a pinch of sea salt and bash until it turns into a green paste. Return the bashed nuts and garlic to the mortar with the lemon juice, a few tablespoons of oil and half the pecorino. Stir together and season well with salt and a little pepper. </li><li>Peel the potatoes, discarding the peel, then continue stripping the potato with the peeler until you have a pile of thin potato strips. </li><li>Add some salt to the boiling water and add the tagliatelle, the trimmed beans and the potato strips.

Drain in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water. </li><li>Toss the cooked pasta and vegetables in a bowl with the pesto. Taste and season again, if necessary. Add a little of the reserved pasta cooking water to moisten the sauce if it’s a little thick and claggy. Serve sprinkled with the remaining pecorino and extra basil.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel and finely grate the ginger into a large bowl, add all the remaining ingredients, chopping any larger pieces of fruit first, and mix well to combine.</li><li>Cover and pop in the fridge overnight to soak and swell. </li><li>Serve topped with fresh fruit – delicious with sliced banana, grapes and finely grated lime zest. Any leftovers will keep happily in the fridge for up to 4 days.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To make your dressing, put the goat’s cheese in a pestle and mortar with a little sea salt and black pepper. (Goat’s cheese is salty anyway, so go easy on the salt). Add the olive oil and juice of the lemon and mix up. Add the walnut oil and the Parmesan and mix again, but not for too long or it will split.</li><li>Put your peaches, cut-side down, on to a white-hot griddle pan and char them nicely on both sides. Remove and put on a large platter or divide between four plates.</li><li>Drizzle the peaches with a little olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put your frisée or endive leaves into a bowl with enough of your goat’s cheese dressing to coat the leaves, and toss together gently and beautifully.</li><li>Grate a little Parmesan over the dressed salad and put a pile of it on each plate, next to the peach halves. Scatter over some baby mint leaves. A genius, simple combo!</li><li>PS Some warmed, crumbly walnuts would be delicious sprinkled over the top. Also a plate of Parma ham, Spanish serrano ham or speck would be great to serve next to this salad.</li></ol>]

Delicious served with yoghurt or soured cream, guacamole and rice, or tortilla chips.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>In a little vegetable oil, fry the onion gently for 10 minutes in a large pan then add the remaining vegetables and stir together. Add the <a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/curry-base-sauce">curry base sauce</a> and simmer gently for around 25 to 30 minutes, taking care not to overcook the vegetables. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a little water to give you the desired consistency.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Put the flours and ground spices in a bowl and slowly pour in 250ml water. Stir with a wooden spoon or a whisk to make a bright yellow batter. Add the salt, then put to one side.  </li><li>Cut the cucumber into long ribbons with a speed peeler and keep to one side. To make the dressing, mix the yoghurt with the coriander and the juice of 1 of the lemons. Add a splash of olive oil, season, and put to one side.  </li><li>Cut the leek, carrots, spring onions and red onions into thin strips - try to get them the size of long matchsticks. Mix with the chillies and the ginger. </li><li>Pour the oil into a large non-stick frying pan and heat until very hot. Mix the vegetables, a little at a time, with some of the batter. Add a pinch of mustard seeds and scoop out a tablespoon of the coated vegetables. Press flat with the back of a fork and carefully drop into the hot oil. Repeat with the remaining vegetables - you may have to fry the bhajis in batches. Move them around a little in the hot oil (with a pair of tongs) to make sure they aren't sticking together. Fry for a minute or so on each side until crispy, then drain on kitchen paper. Place some rocket and cucumber ribbons on individual plates, drizzle with the yoghurt dressing and top with 2 or 3 bhajis. Serve with the lemon wedges.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Very finely slice or shave the beetroots and carrots, using good knife skills, a mandolin on a fine setting (use the guard!) or, most easily, a speed peeler, until you have a pile of thin, wavy, crunchy slices. Place in a big mixing bowl.</li><li>With a sharp knife, slice the celery heart and leaves, the radicchio, the radishes and the fennel as finely as you can and add to the bowl of root veg slices.</li><li>Toss the root vegetables in the <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/grilled-chilli-dressing">grilled chilli dressing</a>, season carefully to taste with sea salt and black pepper, and serve sprinkled with the reserved fennel tops.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Wash the sweet potatoes and bake them, in their skins, in the preheated oven until cooked and soft. Allow to cool (leaving the oven on), then peel and mash them. </li><li>Bash up 1 teaspoon of the coriander seeds and the chillies in a pestle and mortar. Stir with the cinnamon into the mashed sweet potato and season well. Fold the spring onions and beaten egg into the mashed potato. </li><li>Gently melt the butter in a pan. Bash up the remaining coriander seeds. Brush a sheet of filo with some melted butter and sprinkle with a pinch of ground cinnamon and a little of the ground coriander. Cover with the second sheet, and brush and sprinkle as before. Repeat for the third sheet. With a sharp knife, cut the stacked filo sheets into two 15cm squares.  </li><li>Working quickly to prevent the pastry from drying, do the same with the remaining filo sheets. You should now have four squares of filo. Place a generous tablespoon of the sweet potato mixture in the centre of each square and spread out slightly.  Brush the edges of each square with water and fold in half, corner to corner, to make a triangle. Press down at the edges to seal. Brush both sides of each triangle with the rest of the melted butter, place on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven until light brown - this will take about 10 minutes.  </li><li>Mix the red onion with the watercress, mint and parsley. Mix the yoghurt with the lemon juice, a lug of olive oil and the cumin. Dress the salad with the yoghurt dressing and serve with the hot filo briks and the lemon halves.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Trim the outside skin off the pineapple and cut out the hard core that runs down its centre. Lay it on a chopping board and cut it into chunks with a sharp knife. Place in a bowl. </li><li>Cut the flesh of the mango off the stone and scoop out the flesh from the skin with a spoon. Place into the bowl with the pineapple. Cut the papaya in half and scoop out the black seeds inside. Scoop the fruit out of the skin in the same way as with the mango. Place into the bowl. </li><li>Top and tail the kiwi fruit, then, sitting it on one of its flat ends, trim the furry skin off with a sharp knife. Slice the kiwi and place into the bowl. Squeeze the lime juice over your fruit. </li><li>Take four plates and divide the fruit between them. Pick the mint leaves and pound most of them with the sugar in a pestle and mortar or a flavour shaker. Spoon a little yoghurt over the top of each plate and sprinkle over the mint sugar and the rest of the mint leaves and serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To prepare the artichokes, simply trim 5cm below and above the base of the choke. Now what you need to do is trim back your artichoke leaves one by one, clicking them off until you get to the lovely paler yellow and more tender leaves. Using a pointed teaspoon, insert it right into the centre of the artichoke flower and slowly turn it to remove the fluffy choke. Have a little peer in and try to remove most of the choke. Rub the artichoke with lemon to stop it discolouring. You'll get the hang of it when you do the rest. You'll be left with 8 whole trimmed artichokes.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Toss the garlic, almonds, breadcrumbs and herbs into a bowl, season, and loosen with a little olive oil. Scrunch together with your hands and stuff this mixture into the middle of each artichoke, really packing it in. You want to fit these snugly side by side in an appropriately-sized baking dish. Sprinkle any excess filling over the top, drizzle generously with extra virgin olive oil and pour in your wine. Rip off a big enough piece of greaseproof paper, wet and scrunch it under a tap, then tuck it over the artichokes and round the edges of the dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove the greaseproof paper and bake for a final 10 minutes. Serve in the middle of the table with seafood or any white meat.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Heat the stock in a pan over a moderate heat. Heat the olive oil in a pan. Add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 5 minutes until softened. Add the rice to the pan and turn up the heat. Cook for a minute or so, stirring constantly, until the rice looks slightly translucent. Add the wine and keep stirring - any alcohol flavours will evaporate.</li><li>Once the wine has been absorbed by the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside. Add the stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next, until the rice is cooked but still holds its shape - this takes about 15 minutes.</li><li>Stir in the Appenzeller and Taleggio. Remove the pan from the heat and season to taste, then beat in the butter and Parmesan. Place a lid on the pan and leave to rest for 2 to 3 minutes - your risotto will get nice and oozy. Enjoy!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place the porcini in a small dish, add boiling water just to cover, and leave to soak. Get a large casserole-type pan nice and hot, then add a good couple of lugs of olive oil and your fresh mushrooms. Stir around very quickly for a minute, then add your garlic, onion and thyme and a small amount of seasoning. After about a minute you'll probably notice moisture cooking out of the mushrooms and at this point add half of your porcini, chopped up, and the rest left whole. Strain the soaking liquid to remove any grit, and add it to the pan. Carry on cooking for about 20 minutes until most of the moisture disappears.</li><li>Season to taste, and add your stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for around 20 minutes. I usually remove half the soup from the pan and whiz it up to a purée at this point, then pour it back in, adding the parsley and mascarpone, and seasoning carefully to taste.</li><li>You can serve this soup as you like, but there are a few things to remember when finishing it off. Mix together a pinch of salt and pepper with the zest of one lemon and the juice of half of it, then spoon a little of this into the middle of the soup. When you go to eat it, stir it in and it gives a wonderful flavour. Other things you can consider are little slices of grilled crostini put into the bottom of the bowls before the soup is poured over. Or you could even quickly fry some nice-looking mushrooms – like girolles, chanterelles or oysters – and sprinkle these on top of the soup. If I was going to use truffle oil, then I would use it on its own – a few drips on the top just before serving.<br/>

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>Pumpkins are so versatile, the things you can do with them are endless! Their flavour goes well with chilli, nutmeg and sage. If you’ve never cooked one before, you’re in for a real treat.</i></li><li>Preheat the oven to 230ºC/450ºF/gas 8. Cut the lid off the pumpkin and reserve it. Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and keep them to one side. Make the hollow where the seeds were a little bigger by scooping out some more pumpkin flesh. Finely chop this pumpkin flesh and one of the garlic cloves. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Pour in a splash of olive oil, then add the chopped pumpkin, chopped garlic, onion, olives, and half the rosemary. Cook gently for 10 minutes or so until the pumpkin has softened.</li><li>Meanwhile, place the whole garlic clove and the remaining rosemary in a pestle and mortar. Crumble in the dried chilli, add a good pinch of salt, pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon and bash until you have a paste. Add a little olive oil to loosen up the mixture and then rub the inside of the pumpkin with it.</li><li>Season the cooked pumpkin mixture and stir in the rice, cranberries, pistachios and tangerine zest with a pinch each of nutmeg and cinnamon. Mix thoroughly then add the vegetable stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 3 minutes (no longer or the rice will end up overcooked later).</li><li>Tear off a sheet of tin foil that’s large enough to wrap the pumpkin in a double layer and lay on top of a baking tray. Place the pumpkin on top and spoon the rice mixture into it, then place its lid back on. Rub the skin with a little olive oil, wrap it up in the foil and bake in the oven for about an hour. The pumpkin is ready when you can easily push a knife into it. Bring it to the table and open it up in front of everyone. Cut it into thick wedges and tuck in, leaving the skin. Serve with seasonal greens.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>When you halve the peaches, leave the stones in – they will come away a lot more easily after they have been cooked. Put them into a small pan with 4 tablespoons of the sugar, the cinnamon stick and the zest and juice of the orange. Put a lid on top and slowly simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the peach skin and stones can be easily removed. You don't want to cook them to pulp – they should be soft but should still hold their shape. Remove from the heat and put to one side.</li><li>In an appropriately sized high-sided, thick-bottomed pan with a lid, slowly melt two-thirds of the butter. Score down the length of the vanilla pods and remove the seeds by scraping a knife down the inside of each half. Add the seeds to the butter and stir. Continue to cook for 1 minute before adding your rice with the remaining sugar. Turn the heat up to medium, stir the rice, and add the wine, continuing to stir until it has almost cooked away. Now add the milk little by little. Keep the rice on a slow but constant simmer for about 16 or 17 minutes and stir it as often as you can. In this way you can massage the starch out of the rice and this will give you a silky, oozy end product, much like the classic Italian risotto. When the rice has cooked through it should be soft yet still holding its shape. You may need to add a little more milk or water just to adjust the consistency. Remove from the heat, add the grated white chocolate and the rest of the butter, then stir, place a lid on top and leave for a few minutes.</li><li>Remove the skin and stones from the peaches, discard them along with the cinnamon stick, and take the peaches to the table with your block of dark chocolate, snapped into small pieces. Spoon the risotto on to plates, then push a couple of pieces of dark chocolate into the middle of each one. Just so you know, a perfect risotto should slowly creep and ooze to the side of your plate, so don't worry if it starts to spread out! Gently tear the peaches and place some on each plate, then drizzle over some of the lovely juice and sprinkle over a few mint leaves. By the time you go to eat it, the dark chocolate will have melted. Joy joy joy!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>A lot of people don’t realise that pea shoots are the best part of the pea plant to eat. They make a wonderful salad ‘leaf’. If you can’t get hold of them, then use a mixture of rocket and baby spinach leaves instead. </i></li><li>Also, the point of this salad is that you use fresh, raw peas. If you can’t get them, then make a different salad.</li><li>Add your peas and pea shoots to a bowl with the radicchio. Add the lemon juice and three times as much extra virgin olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the salad between your plates and crumble over the cheese. So simple, but so delicious!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Get your frying pan on a medium to low heat and add enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of a large nonstick pan (about 1 tablespoon).</li><li>Crack the eggs into the pan. As the oil gets hotter you’ll see it start to change the color of the eggs. If the oil starts to spit it’s because it’s too hot, so turn the heat right down. Cook until the tops of the whites are set but the yolk is still runny.</li><li>When they’re ready, remove the pan from the heat and take the eggs out using a spatula. Place on a plate and dab them with some paper towels to soak up any excess oil. Serve on toast – no need to butter it – with a sprinkling of the sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li><li>Delicious served on some 7-grain bread.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Smash up half of the pine nuts to a paste, then put it into a big heatproof bowl with the rest of the whole pine nuts, the lemon juice and zest, the finely chopped parsley and the extra virgin olive oil. Stir and add the Parmesan and pecorino.</li><li>What you should have now is a reasonably thick sauce, which you should think of more as a dressing, so taste it and think about how the different flavours are coming through. I want you to balance the flavours so you end up with something quite zingy because, as the sauce heats up and the cheese melts, the flavour of the lemon will calm down a lot. Season with some freshly ground black pepper. Taste it and if you think you haven’t got the balance right, simply add a little more oil and Parmesan.</li><li>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil for your pasta. Sit the sauce bowl on top of the pan while the water’s heating up – this will take the chill out of the sauce and warm it through slightly.</li><li>When the water starts to boil, remove the bowl and add your pasta to the water. Cook it according to the packet instructions then drain in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water.</li><li>Toss the pasta with the sauce and a little of the reserved cooking water to help loosen it up a bit. The heat from the pasta will melt the cheese, allowing all the lovely sauce to coat it. If you find the sauce is too thick then add a little more water. It’s not supposed to be claggy, thick and miserable, but incredibly silky, fresh and fragrant.</li><li>Have one last taste to balance the flavours, and serve with a little extra Parmesan shaved over the top and a sprinkle of parsley leaves. Eat immediately.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Cut the bigger tomatoes into slices about 1cm inch thick. You can halve the cherry tomatoes or leave them whole. Then sprinkle them all with a good dusting of sea salt. Put them in a colander and leave them for 30 minutes. What's going to happen here is that the salt will draw the excess moisture out of the tomatoes, intensifying their flavour. Don't worry about the salad being too salty, as a lot of the salt drips away.</li><li>Place the tomatoes in a large bowl and dress with enough extra virgin olive oil to loosen (approximately 6 tablespoons), and 1–2 tablespoons of vinegar, but do add these to your own taste. Toss around and check for seasoning – you may or may not need salt but will certainly need pepper. Add the garlic. Now start to add the horseradish. Stir in a couple of teaspoons to begin with, toss around and taste. If you like it a bit hotter, add a bit more horseradish. All I do now is get some finely sliced flat-leaf parsley (stalks and leaves) and mix this into the tomatoes. Toss everything together and serve as a wonderful salad, making sure you mop up all the juices with some nice squashy bread.</li><li>This salad is fantastic with roast beef, goat's cheese or jacket potatoes. And to be honest, even if you put these tomatoes in a roasting tray and roasted them with some sausages scattered around them it would be nice.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>In summer, a light pea soup feels totally right – the watercress in this recipe adds a mustardy bite.</i></li><li>Heat a large saucepan and pour in a little olive oil. Throw in the chopped onion and celery. Turn the heat down and cook very gently with the lid on for 10 minutes, or until the onion has softened, but not browned. </li><li>Add the potato and stock and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes or until the potato is cooked. Next, drop in the peas and watercress and simmer for a further 5 minutes until the peas are cooked. </li><li>Remove the pan from the heat. Whiz the soup with a hand blender, or in a liquidizer, until smooth. Taste, then season with salt and pepper. </li><li>Serve the soup with a spoonful of soured cream swirled in, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some crusty bread and butter. </li><li>Tip: You can use frozen peas – just simmer them in the stock a couple of minutes</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>First of all, finely slice your red onion. Once that's done, finely slice your chillies then roughly chop your tomatoes, mixing them in with the onion and chillies. Scrape all of this, and the juice, into a bowl and dress with the juice of half a lemon and 3 tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil. Season to taste. Heat the chickpeas in a pan, then add 90 per cent of them to the bowl. Mush up the remaining chickpeas and add these as well – they will give a nice creamy consistency. Allow to marinate for a little while and serve at room temperature.</li><li>Just as you're ready to serve, give the salad a final dress with the fresh mint and basil. Taste one last time for seasoning – you may want to add the juice from your remaining lemon half at this point. Place on a nice serving dish and crumble over the feta cheese.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>In Palermo there's a night market called Il Borgo, where all the locals gather to eat at little stalls selling things like chickpea fritters, boiled baby octopus and some stuff that you wouldn't want to eat, like gizzards, spleen and other dirty wobbly things! A lot of the veg stalls have massive cauldrons of boiled potatoes and artichokes to serve to their customers – I guess you could say this is the original fast food – and they tasted absolutely brilliant.</i></li><li>Some of the stalls also make a version of this salad, which is absolutely delicious. They tend to dress it and have it hanging around for quite some time so it becomes a bit sloppy and past its best, but the principle of the salad is fantastic and all the locals absolutely adore it. In Sicily you can get these terrific Cedro lemons which are mainly pith and they are amazing in salads – but you may not be able to get hold of them. In this case I wouldn't recommend you use normal lemons as the flavour is quite different. </li><li>The way potatoes are cooked in Sicily is very long and very slow, on a low simmer with plenty of salt in the water. This is a fantastic method of making normal potatoes soft and floury, but in the case of new potatoes it would be a crime. So add them to fast-boiling salted water, as this will help retain a lot of their flavour, and cook them till nice and tender. The softer you can get them while still holding their shape, the better. While the potatoes are cooking, wash all your salad leaves and put them into a nice big bowl with the mint and fennel. If using a Cedro lemon, add the slices to the salad at this point.</li><li>For the dressing, mix the orange juice and vinegar in a glass jar or bowl with about twice as much extra virgin olive oil. Add the oregano and capers and season to taste with salt and pepper. Give it a good mix and have a taste. Don't forget that you want the flavour to be a little over the top, so that by the time you've dressed the salad with it and it has mixed with all the other flavours it's perfect because it's become more subtle. Drain the potatoes when cooked, then allow them to steam in a colander for 5 minutes. Throw them into the salad while still warm and toss together well. Absolutely fantastic – great with a plate of grilled fish or as a lunchie salad on its own.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Crush the garlic and finely slice the chilli and spring onion. Peel and finely slice the red onion, and mix with the garlic, chilli and spring onion. </li><li>Shred the mangetout, slice the mushrooms and water chestnuts, and mix with the shredded cabbage in a separate bowl to the onion mixture.</li><li>Heat your wok until it’s really hot. Add a splash of oil – it should start to smoke – then the chilli and onion mix. Stir for just 2 seconds before adding the other mix. Flip and toss the vegetables in the wok if you can; if you can’t, don’t worry, just keep the vegetables moving with a wooden spoon, turning them over every few seconds so they all keep feeling the heat of the bottom of the wok. Season with sea salt and black pepper. </li><li>After a minute or two, the vegetables should have begun to soften. Add the soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and stir in. After about 30 seconds the vegetables should smell amazing! Tip on to a serving dish, sprinkle over some sesame seeds and tuck in.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>One of the things I love to do is to stir-fry the corn kernels in a hot wok or frying pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a tablespoon of chopped ginger, a teaspoon of chopped chilli, a handful of chopped fresh parsley and a couple of tablespoons of low-salt soy sauce. You can vary the flavours with different herbs, but this is a good base to start with.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>This is a great way to cook aubergines, and probably one that not a lot of people would think of doing. To me, steamed aubergine sounds horrible but, believe me, this recipe is fantastic. Aubergines are usually fried or roasted, which makes them soak up loads of oil, but steaming means they go really soft and tender so that they're lighter to eat – which means you can eat a lot more! All round the world there are so many different varieties of aubergines – long, round, purple, green – so keep your eyes peeled and try cooking them all.</i></li><li>Put some water in a pan and bring it to the boil. Slice the aubergines in half lengthways and place them in your steamer with the cut side facing up. Steam them for about 10 minutes – to check whether they're ready, simply squeeze the sides gently and if they're silky soft then they're done. Remove them from the steamer, place them in a colander and leave to cool.</li><li>Now make your dressing by mixing all the ingredients together. When the aubergines are warm this is the perfect time to flavour them. Cut them up into rough 2.5cm dice, then dress them and toss. Serve immediately as a salad, tapas dish or as a vegetable next to any simple cooked fish. Just really tasty!</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Boil any larger white-skinned broad beans for 30 seconds, then drain. When cool, pinch their skins off – they’ll taste less bitter if you do this. Now whiz the coriander and half the mint in a food processor.</li><li>Season with sea salt and black pepper, then add the spices, chilli, broad beans and lemon zest and whiz until finely chopped (stopping once or twice to scrape the mixture off the sides). Sprinkle in the flour and pulse for a few seconds. Don’t add any more flour or the mixture will become too dry.</li><li>Get a large saucepan and pour in the vegetable oil till it’s 5 to 7cm deep. Be careful – keep kids and pets away, and make sure the handle isn’t sticking out so you don’t accidentally catch it and spill the hot oil.</li><li>Heat the oil. To check whether it’s hot enough for frying, drop in the piece of potato – as soon as it sizzles and floats to the top, you’re in business. Remove the potato and discard it.</li><li>Cover a plate with a sheet of greaseproof paper. Scoop up a small amount of the broad bean mixture and either use your hands or two spoons to shape it into little rounds, then put them on to the plate.</li><li>When they’re all done, carefully lower one of them into the hot oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper. When you’re got the hang of it, fry the rest of them – they should all fit into the pan at the same time but, if not, simply do batches.</li><li>For your lemon minted yoghurt, squeeze half the lemon juice into the yoghurt.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel the celeriac, then slice about 1 and half centimetre inch off the bottom of it and roll it on to that flat edge, so it's nice and safe to slice. Slice and dice it all up into 1cm/½ inch-ish cubes. Don't get your ruler out – they don't have to be perfect. </li><li>Put a casserole-type pot on a high heat, add 3 good lugs of olive oil, then add the celeriac.

Stir around to coat and fry quite fast, giving a little colour, for 5 minutes. </li><li>Turn the heat down to a simmer, add the water or stock, place a lid on top and cook for around 25 minutes, until tender. </li><li>Season carefully to taste and stir around with a spoon to smash up the celeriac. Some people like to keep it in cubes, some like to mash it, but I think it looks and tastes much better if you smash it, which is somewhere in the middle. You can serve this with just about any meat you can think of.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3.</li><li>Score the tops of the tomatoes with a cross. Take an earthenware dish that the tomatoes will fit snugly into, and sprinkle the garlic and basil all over the bottom of it. Stand the tomatoes next to each other in the tray, on top of the garlic and basil, then push the bay leaves well into the scores in the tomatoes and season well. Lay the leeks on a board and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Using a rolling pin, press down on top of the leeks to really squeeze the seasoning into them.

It's available in every single supermarket, we walk past it all the time, and yet we still take no notice of it. It's an incredible vegetable, it's really good for you and you only need to use 2 or 3 ingredients to bring it to life and blow people's socks off.</i></li><li>Shave off the celeriac ends and throw them away, then use your knife to peel away the outside skin, cutting away any cracks and crannies as you go. Once you've cut the edge you’ll be able to see the thickness of the skin you need to peel away. Chop the celeriac up into slices, then into rough 1cm cubes.</li><li>Put a casserole-type pan on a medium-high heat and add a lug of olive oil. Rip in the lemon thyme - the smells from this will be outrageous – then go straight in with the diced celeriac and a generous pinch of salt. Turn the heat down to medium, pop the lid on and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender. Make sure you keep it moving - you want it to fry lightly from the bottom, and kind of steam in its own moisture. </li><li>At this stage, you have two choices. You can either serve it up blonde or you can take the lid off and fry for a further 4 minutes or so, to take the colour much darker. This is such a flexible recipe, you can make it the day before and reheat when you need, or you can blitz it up with some stock for a delicious soup. Give it a try.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>Jerusalem artichokes are sweet and almost garlicky and mushroomy and gorgeous. Although called artichokes they’re actually tubers – like rough and ready potatoes. You can scrub and roast them whole like mini jacket potatoes and split them open, drizzled with a little chilli oil. You can even use them in a salad with smoky bacon. A Jerusalem artichoke’s best friends are sage, thyme, butter, bacon, bay, cream, breadcrumbs, cheese and anything smoked.</i></li><li>To serve 4, you will need 600g/1lb 6oz of Jerusalem artichokes. Peel them, then cut them into chunks. Place them in an oiled frying pan and fry on a medium heat until golden on both sides, then add a few bay leaves, 2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced, a splash of white wine vinegar, some salt and pepper, and place a lid on top. After about 20 to 25 minutes they will have softened up nicely and you can remove the lid and the bay leaves. Continue cooking for a couple of minutes to crisp the artichoke slices up one last time, then serve straight away. Personally, I think they go well with both meat and fish and are particularly good in a plate of antipasti, or in soups or warm salads.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>I'm not quite sure where I got the inspiration for this recipe – I think it was actually when I was making bread one day and I incorporated some really sweet caramelized garlic and almonds into a focaccia. There's a slightly Spanish feel to the main ingredients – think of it as putting a bunch of old friends together and having a good party! My mother's initial reaction was, ‘My God, that's a lot of garlic, you'll stink!’ but don't let the amount put you off, as when garlic is roasted in its skin the pungent flavour is replaced by a jammy sweetness which is divine.</i></li><li>Roast the garlic cloves in a preheated oven at 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 for around half an hour until soft to the touch. Meanwhile, take a large pot and slowly fry the white onion in 4 tablespoons of olive oil for about 10 minutes until really soft and translucent. Add the cream and the stock, bring back to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes, awaiting your garlic. Remove the garlic from the oven and allow to cool slightly before squeezing out all the sweet, golden paste. Whisk this into the soup. Discard the garlic skins.</li><li>Remove the crusts from your ciabatta, rip up the bread into small pieces and throw into the soup. Add the sherry vinegar, then allow the soup to simmer for 5 more minutes. Whiz it until smooth in your food processor with your toasted almonds. Season nicely to taste and serve in big bowls sprinkled with some orange segments, torn up coriander and mint, and drizzled with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil.</li><li>Try this: You can eat this cold in the summer – it's obviously going to be thick, which I think is a nice thing, but you can thin it with a little milk or stock if you want to.</li><li>And this: You may want to big up the sherry vinegar to give it that twang you get with a Spanish gazpacho soup.</li><li>Or this: There's a similar recipe from Spain where sliced white grapes are added to the soup – this contrasts really well with the garlic, so give it a go. A handful will do. Nice when eaten both hot and cold.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Blanch the cauliflower in salted boiling water for a couple of minutes then drain in a colander, allowing it to steam dry (you don't want any water left in your cauliflower or it won't roast properly). Toss it in a good lug of olive oil and the butter. In a pestle and mortar, bash your spices and chillies with a pinch of salt, then mix them with your almonds and put in a hot, dry ovenproof pan to slowly toast them. After a couple of minutes, add the cauliflower. When it gets a nice bit of colour on it, add the lemon zest and juice and mix around well. Fry for about a minute longer then pop the pan into the preheated oven for about 15 minutes to crisp up.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. I like to serve 4 or 5 baby leeks per person, depending on their size. Lightly trim both ends and peel back the first or second layer of leaves and discard. Drop the leeks in a pan of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes to soften - this is called blanching. Drain them well (if there's too much water in them they won't roast properly) and toss in a bowl with a good lug of olive oil, a splash of red wine vinegar, the chopped thyme leaves and the garlic. Arrange the leeks in one layer in a baking tray or earthenware dish and roast in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes until golden and almost caramelized.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>If you’re going to use cooked carrots in a salad you’ve got to make it with some attitude! This fantastic Moroccan-style salad combines roast carrots with avocados – and because they have the same texture in your mouth, I thought I’d add the chargrilled flavour and crunch of toasted ciabatta to round things off. With spices, seeds, yoghurt and a delicious citrus dressing, you’ve got a winner. </i></li><li><br/>
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Parboil your carrots in boiling, salted water for 10 minutes, until they are very nearly cooked, then drain and put them into a roasting tray. You should flavour them while they’re steaming hot, so while the carrots are cooking get a pestle and mortar and smash up the cumin seeds, chillies, salt and pepper. Add the garlic and thyme leaves and smash up again until you have a kind of paste. The idea here is to build up the flavours. Add enough extra virgin olive oil to generously cover the paste, and a good swig of vinegar. This will be like a marinade, a rub and a dressing all in one! Stir together, then pour over the carrots in the tray, coating them well. Add the orange and lemon halves, cut-side down. These will roast along with the carrots, and their juice can be used as the basis of the dressing. Place in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden.  <br/>
While the carrots are roasting, halve and peel your avocados, discarding the stones, then cut them into wedges lengthways and place in a big bowl. Remove the carrots from the oven and add them to the avocados. Carefully, using some tongs, squeeze the roasted orange and lemon juice into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil and a little swig of red wine vinegar. Season, and pour this dressing over the carrots and avocados. Mix together, have a taste and correct the seasoning. Call your gang round the table while you toast or griddle your ciabatta slices. </li><li>Tear the toasted bread into little pieces and add to the dressed carrot and avocado. Mix together, toss in the salad leaves and cress and transfer to a big platter or divide between individual plates. Spoon over a nice dollop of yoghurt, sprinkle over your toasted seeds and drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Once you’ve peeled the celeriac, chuck away the skin and then carry on peeling around it, giving you long ribbons. If they break every now and again it doesn’t matter. Continue until you reach the fluffy tasteless inner core, which you should throw away. Remove and discard the chunky stalks from the parsley, then finely slice the thinner stalks and roughly chop the leaves.</li><li>Put your celeriac and parsley into a large bowl and mix together with all the other ingredients. Season to taste, adding a little more vinegar if need be, then serve straight away.</li><li>Try this: Put some of this salad on a plate, then cover it completely with some smoked salmon and plenty of ground black pepper.</li><li>Or this: Roast a nice chicken. Allow it to cool and serve with this salad.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>The other day I had a nice little roast in the oven – comfort food for a great Sunday afternoon. I had a bunch of raw beetroot to use up, so I thought it would be good to have something nice and zingy to munch on while I was waiting for the chicken to cook – like some tapas or antipasti to get my tastebuds going. You can get some great beetroots these days – fantastic colours.</i></li><li>I took the leaves off the beetroots and threw them away, as I didn't need them for this salad (although it's worth remembering that they're edible and that they taste nicer than Swiss chard or spinach!). I washed the beetroots and then, using a speed peeler, I peeled them all down into really thin slices and flavoured them with salt, pepper, chopped flat-leaf parsley and a little grated fresh horseradish to give a nice bit of heat. Then I left them for 5 to 10 minutes so that the acid from the horseradish would soften the beetroot. The horseradish is optional, but it gives a good twang.</li><li>This salad is lovely on a bit of toast, with maybe a splash of vodka or a little block of crumbled feta cheese. Really nice to pick at before you have dinner.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Radicchio, like other bitter leaves such as Belgian endive, dandelions, cicoria and treviso, becomes extra special when its bitterness is balanced with other tastes – like the sweetness of balsamic vinegar, the saltiness of Parmesan, or the crunchy pepperiness of rocket. Sometimes in life you have one particular thing which, on its own, is nothing, yet mix it up in the right combination and somehow it becomes genius – it’s like this with recipes, and especially this one.</li><li>Get yourself a large bowl and, for each person, toss together a handful of rocket with a small handful of grated Parmesan cheese and a quarter of a radicchio, finely sliced. Dress this with a lug of balsamic vinegar, three times as much extra virgin olive oil, and a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix carefully, grate over a little extra Parmesan, and eat straight away. You can vary it by adding things like toasted pine nuts, roasted red onions or crispy bacon.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>To make the guacamole I use 2 or 3 ripe avocados, 2 or 3 ripe deseeded tomatoes and a couple of deseeded red chillies, and I throw all this into a food processor with a handful of peeled and chopped spring onions and a good handful of fresh coriander. Once this has been chopped up nice and fine, I add a couple more chopped tomatoes, a good pinch of salt and half of another avocado, chopped, to give it a nice chunky texture. Transfer everything into a bowl and season carefully with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon or lime juice. If you decide to buy ready-made guacamole, which is a bit lazy but probably very realistic, you can put it into a bowl and chirp it up a bit with a squeeze of lemon juice, a little extra salt and a bit of chilli to give it a kick.</li><li>To fill the quesadillas you will need a couple of big handfuls of grated Cheddar and/or Red Leicester cheese, some finely sliced spring onions, a couple of handfuls of chopped fresh coriander, and a red pepper and some red or green chillies all deseeded and finely chopped. Mix all this up in a bowl and then sprinkle half a handful between two layers of tortilla. You can make up 4, 10 or even 20 quesadillas and keep them in the fridge until you need them if you want.</li><li>Some people like to fry them in oil, but this makes them greasy and is not all that healthy. You can grill them, but I like to put them in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, so that after about a minute and a half on each side you are left with a really crispy outside and an oozy, stringy filling. Serve the quesadillas cut into quarters, with the guacamole, soured cream and a beer.</li><li>PS You can also posh them up a bit using grilled chicken or seafood, leftover pork, shellfish, or a selection of grilled vegetables.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Make the dressing by mixing together the olive oil, lemon juice and crème fraîche or fromage frais. Cook the potatoes in plenty of boiling salted water for around 20 minutes until tender, and drain well. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, rub off the skins with a knife and slice into bite-size pieces. Mix with the dressing, then add the radishes and herbs and season well to taste.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>As a child I always thought that a simple fruit option for dessert was flippin' boring and it never excited me in the slightest. But I now realize it was because no one did anything remotely exciting with the fruit. This recipe, however, I would definitely have enjoyed as a kid. It's one of those combinations that just explodes in your mouth and you can't get enough of it. Once you try it, you'll never forget it.</i></li><li>Buy yourself a ripe pineapple. It should smell slightly sweet and you should be able to remove the leaves quite easily. Cut both ends off and peel the skin with a knife, removing any little black bits. Then cut the pineapple into quarters and remove the slightly less tasty core, which I usually discard or suck on while preparing the rest of the dish. Finely slice your quarters, lengthways, as thin as you can. Lay out flat in one or two layers on a large plate. Don't refrigerate this – just put it to one side.</li><li>Take the plate to the table after dinner with a pot of yoghurt that can be passed round, then return with a pestle and mortar with the sugar in it. Your family or guests will probably think you've gone mad, especially if you ignore them while you do this, but pick the mint leaves and add them to the sugar. Bash the hell out of it in the pestle and mortar at the table. You'll see the sugar change colour and it will smell fantastic. It normally takes about a minute to do if you've got a good wrist action. Sprinkle the mint sugar over the plate of pineapple – making sure you don't let anyone nick any pineapple before you sprinkle the sugar over. What a fantastic thing. If you have any leftovers, you could always make a piña colada with them.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>In an appropriately sized pot, slowly fry the onion in the olive oil for about 5 minutes until translucent and soft but not coloured at all. Get your bunch of thyme, tie it up with a little string and add to the pot with the celeriac, potatoes and stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for 40 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Add the cream, bring back to the boil, then remove the thyme and purée the mixture in a liquidizer or food processor. Season carefully to taste, adding the truffle oil tablespoon by tablespoon – the oil can vary in strength depending on the brand. Divide between your serving bowls. Feel free to improvise by adding croûtons, a little extra cream or, if you're really lucky, some real black or white truffles shaved over the top.</li><li>Try this: If you want to give an edge to this comforting soup, try dressing some chopped parsley and celery leaves with a little olive oil and lemon juice. Sprinkle over the soup at the last minute before serving.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/gas 5. </li><li>Peel the potatoes, cutting any larger ones so they’re all an even-size – twice the size of a squash ball is about right. </li><li>Wash the potatoes in cold water to get rid of any extra starch then tip into a large pot, cover with cold salted water and parboil for 7 minutes, then drain in a colander and leave to steam dry for 3 minutes. </li><li>Give the colander a bit of a shake to help chuff up the potatoes – this will help to make them super-crisp later on. </li><li>At this point, you need to decide which flavour combo to go with. Tip the potatoes into a large tray in one layer, and add the fat – olive oil, butter or goose fat – then season really well with sea salt and black pepper.</li><li>Toss the potatoes in the fat (you could get the potatoes up to this stage the day before, simply cover them with clingfilm or tin foil and pop in the fridge or in a cool place until needed), then roast for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden and three quarters cooked. </li><li>Now’s the time for my trick. Gently squash each potato with a potato masher to increase the surface area – the more of your potato that’s in contact with the pan, the crispier it will be. </li><li>Add 1 good lug of oil to a small bowl and pick and/or tear in the herbs. If opting for flavour combo 2, peel in a good few strips of clementine zest with a speed-peeler – you won’t eat these but they’ll add amazing flavour. Break up the garlic bulb, adding the unpeeled cloves to the bowl, along with a splash of red wine vinegar, then scrunch and mix it up a bit. </li><li>Add your chosen flavour combo to the potatoes and give the pan a good shake, then pop back in the hot oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until gnarly, crispy, bubbly and delicious. </li><li>Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain off some of the excess fat, then tuck in!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>The simplest way to cook spinach is in a pan with a little butter, a grating of nutmeg and a tiny squeeze of lemon juice with a lid on to let it steam. This will taste great, and it goes with just about anything – pasta, fish or meat. If there is any excess moisture when the spinach is cooked, just tilt the pan so it runs to the other side and pour it away. Let the spinach sit for a minute and then serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. </li><li>Throw the tomatoes into a large roasting tin, drizzle them with olive oil, season with some salt and pepper and pop them in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Once they’re roasted, squash the tomatoes with a fork to get the juices going and drizzle over some balsamic vinegar. </li><li>Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta according to the pack instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and add the roasted tomato sauce and the olives. Tear over most of the basil leaves and toss everything together. Season and serve with the reserved basil leaves scattered over and some freshly grated pecorino.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Deseed and slice the peppers and put them in a large frying pan over a medium heat with a little olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Place a lid on, and cook slowly for 15 minutes until softened. Don't rush this too much, as cooking the peppers slowly like this really helps to bring out the flavour. </li><li>While the peppers are cooking, peel and finely slice the onion, and peel and grate the garlic. Finely chop the parsley leaves and reserve the stalks.</li><li>Add the onion to the pan and cook for a further 20 minutes. Then add the garlic and parsley stalks and toss around, keeping everything moving in the pan. Cook for about 3 minutes most. Have a little taste, and season with a bit more salt and pepper. Add the vinegar – it will sizzle away, so give everything a good toss. </li><li>Grate the Parmesan and add one handful of the Parmesan and the mascarpone or crème fraîche, if using, and turn the heat down to minimum while you cook the pasta.</li><li>Meanwhile, put a large pot of salted water on to boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the packet instructions. When cooked, drain in a colander, reserving some of the cooking water. </li><li>Put the peppers, pasta and parsley leaves into a large warmed bowl. Give them a good toss together, then add a little of the pasta cooking water and a few good lugs of extra virgin olive oil to coat the pasta nicely. Serve straight away sprinkled with the rest of the Parmesan.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Get a high-sided pan or wok on a medium-high heat to get nice and hot, and pour your stock into a small pan on a low heat to get warm. To make your fragrant soup base, add the lime leaves, chillies, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and a pinch of salt to a food processor. Chop the top few leaves off your bunch of coriander and pop to one side, then add the rest to the processor and blitz for 30 seconds or so until fairly fine. With the processor still running, add a few good lugs of olive oil, the five-spice and ground cumin. Tip this mixture straight into your hot pan, you can add a splash of stock to loosen it if you want, and fry and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts smelling fantastic. Add your sliced onion, then cook gently for 8 to 10 minutes.</li><li>Add the squash to the pan and stir well, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the squash is lovely and soft. At this point, add the rice and give it a really good stir. If it looks a bit dry, you can add a splash of water here. Continue to simmer for about 8 minutes until the rice is almost cooked, then add the coconut milk and bring back to the boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes until hot through and thickened a little. I like to squash up some of the squash at this point too. </li><li>Take the pan off the heat, give it a good stir, then taste and season carefully with salt and pepper. To give it a bit of twang add the lime juice – the amount you need will depend on how juicy your limes are, so keep tasting it as you go. Scatter with more sliced fresh chilli and your reserved coriander leaves before serving. </li><li> You can then use this as a receptacle for your hot soup, and as long as it’s an inch or so thick, it should keep warm for a good hour or so. Have it sitting out at the party with a load of little cups and bowls lined up next to it and a bunch of lime wedges, and let everyone help themselves!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Add your fresh or dried and soaked beans to a pan of water with the bay leaf – this will help to flavour the beans and soften their skins. Squash the tomato, peel the potato and add both to the pan. Cook until the beans are tender – taste one to check they’re nice and soft. Dried beans can take up to an hour, but check fresh ones after 25 minutes. Drain (reserving about half a glass of the cooking water), and discard the bay leaf, tomato and potato.</li><li>Peel and finely chop your onions, carrots and garlic. Trim and finely chop the celery. </li><li>Heat a saucepan with a splash of olive oil and add the vegetables to the pan with the ground fennel seeds and chilli. Sweat very slowly on a low heat with the lid just ajar for around 15 to 20 minutes until soft, but not brown. </li><li>Add the tomatoes and bring to a gentle simmer for a few minutes.</li><li>Add the cooked and drained beans with a little of the water they were cooked in, and bring back to the boil. </li><li>Finely slice the cavolo nero (stalks and all) and add to the pan – it will look like loads, but don’t worry as it will cook down.</li><li>Tear the bread into chunks, then moisten with a little of the cooking water and stir it in too. The soup should be thick but not dry, so add a little more cooking water if you need to loosen it. Continue cooking for about 30 minutes – you want to achieve a silky, thick soup.</li><li>Season the ribollita with sea salt and black pepper, and stir in 4 good lugs of good-quality Tuscan extra virgin olive oil before serving to give it a glossy velvety texture. </li><li>Delicious served on a cold winter’s day with lots and lots of Chianti!</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>First of all pod your beans. When I’m doing mine I round up friends and family to get the job done quicker. I also put the larger ones in one bowl and the smaller ones in another – they’ll need different cooking times. Blanch the beans in unsalted boiling water for a couple of minutes, giving the large ones a bit longer (don’t add salt, as this will toughen the skins). Drain them and lay them flat on a tray to cool down slightly. This salad always works best when the beans are eaten slightly warm. If you’re making it in advance, though, you could always give them a quick flash in the microwave just before serving. Remove the skins from the larger beans if necessary. Place in a bowl and dress with the juice of 1 lemon and three times as much extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Add a little more lemon juice if needed – feel free to adjust to your taste. At this stage I like to finely slice half the mint and add it to the beans while they sit and marinate for a little while.</li><li>In a shallow pan, on a medium heat, fry the chopped onion, cumin seeds and chilli in a little olive oil. Stir and cook until softened. As the onions start to colour, add your breadcrumbs and mix these really well into the onions. Continue to cook until the crumbs are crispy and golden, then season them to taste and put to one side. To serve, divide the yoghurt or soured cream between four plates or bowls. Give the broad beans a final toss, add the rest of the mint leaves, and divide between the plates on top of the yoghurt. Finally, sprinkle over the warm spiced crunchy bits.</li><li>Sometimes I like to zest a bit of lemon over the top to give a little edge. Fantastic served with grilled chicken or as a tapas or antipasti style thing. Also great with flatbreads like pitta.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>First of all, finely slice your carrots into matchstick-sized batons. Finely slice your radishes – you can leave a little of the tops on if you like. Quarter your apples, remove the cores and finely slice. Add all these to a bowl with the rest of the ingredients, apart from the sesame seeds. Toss together, carefully checking the seasoning, and serve with the sesame seeds sprinkled over the top. Eat straight away.</li><li>Try this: Turn it into a warm salad by adding some pan-seared chicken, prawns or scallops which have been dusted with a little paprika.</li><li>And this: Make it more of a snack by frying some halloumi cheese until golden with some chopped fresh chilli and crumbling this over the top.</li><li>Or this: Grill some pitta bread and serve stuffed with the Crunch Salad. Crumble in some feta cheese too. Lovely.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Add the peas to a cold pan. Put the small bunch of mint on top of the peas, then boil the kettle. Pour just enough boiling water over the peas and mint to cover them, then put the pan on a high heat with a lid on. Bring back to the boil and cook until the peas are just perfect and tender – this should only be a couple of minutes. Immediately drain in a colander, then place the peas and mint into a salad-type bowl. Sprinkle with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice or a swig of good-quality red or white wine vinegar. Cover the peas and mint with the olive oil (it’s important to use the best you can get, as the better the quality, the better the dish) and mix around. Put to one side for half an hour, after which the flavours will really have started to develop.</li><li>There are so many things you can serve these peas with: from grilled fish to bruschetta or crostini, roasted or grilled lamb cutlets or pork, or served next to a hearty roast chicken. It’s always exciting to see lovely green peas under golden green oil.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>This simple little salad can be quite extraordinary, but you’ve got to season it with that Mexican spirit by being brave with the lime juice, salt and chilli, until it’s singing in your mouth. It does a great job of waking up the other things it’s served with – a few spoonfuls of this next to a grilled chicken breast or pork chop would be an absolute celebration.</i></li><li>Veg-wise, the onion, coriander and white cabbage are non-negotiable, as they form the base of this salad, but feel free to have a play with the other ingredients and use things like fennel or asparagus. Basically whatever’s in season and available should be a nice addition.</li><li>The easiest and quickest way to make this is to use a food processor with a slicer attachment or a mandolin. If you don’t have either of those, use a speed peeler, or simply grate everything finely.</li><li>Shred your white and red cabbage into two separate piles. Put just the white cabbage into a large bowl with the radishes, carrots and most of the coriander. Mix everything together really well, then kick up the flavours by adding almost all the chopped chilli, the sliced red onion and a good few lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Add most of the lime juice and a good pinch of sea salt, then toss together and have a taste. Just keep adjusting everything, adding more fragrance with the coriander, heat with the last of the chilli and acid with another squeeze of lime juice, until it’s just right for you.</li><li>When you’re happy, fold in the red cabbage right before serving so it doesn’t stain everything, and tuck in.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Use a pestle and mortar to crush the coriander seeds, but don’t let them get too fine. Peel off long thick strips of lemon zest and place in a bowl with the olives. Squeeze the lemon then top with 3 times as much extra virgin olive oil. Add salt, pepper and the crushed coriander seeds. Pour the dressing over the olives and leave to marinate. The longer you leave them, the better they’ll taste.</li></ol>]

Spread out evenly using the palm of your hands and gently expel the gas from the dough (you’ll notice that the dough is airy). </li><li>Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over the surface of the dough using your fingertips; 'dimple' the dough ensuring that you don’t press all the way through to the base. </li><li>Cover with the tea towel and leave to rest in a warm place for a further 20 to 40 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.</li><li>Place the baking tray in the wood-fired oven for 15 minutes or until lightly golden; this will vary depending on temperature so it's best to keep a close eye on the bread for your first attempt. </li><li>Just prior to the bread coming out of the wood-fired oven, mix together 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of water. Whisk lightly until it becomes an opaque emulsion. Once removed, brush the bread with the emulsion (I use a pastry brush), which makes the bread surface moist. </li><li>To finish, stud the bread with fresh sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. Serve warm with a small bowl of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i> This dish can be eaten either cold as an antipasto or warm as a vegetable contorno. The great thing about it is that you can use any combination of greens, such as baby cabbage leaves, Swiss chard and even salad leaves like cos, gem or Romaine. You can easily buy a big bag of spinach, rocket and watercress and use some yellow celery leaves and other herbs like basil, parsley, sorrel and fennel tops to give you a good mixture. Most Italians have a vegetable garden, and no matter how big or small it is they always have greens and veggies to hand. This recipe sees the more robust leaves blanched first, then wilted down in a pan with the salad leaves, herbs and garlic until soft and tender.</i></li><li>Blanch the cabbage leaves and chard to perfection in a pot of salted boiling water for a couple of minutes, then drain in a colander and leave to cool down a little. Put a couple of good lugs of olive oil into a large frying pan or casserole type dish and add the sliced garlic. As soon as it starts to take on the smallest amount of colour, throw in your salad leaves then the cabbage and Swiss chard. </li><li>Cook on a medium heat for about 4 to 5 minutes, moving the greens around the pan with a spoon or a pair of tongs, then add your herbs and cook for a further minute. Remove from the heat and season carefully to taste with salt and pepper, some good-quality extra virgin olive oil and enough lemon juice to give it a little kick.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>A mushroom risotto can be taken in many different ways, depending on what kind of mushrooms you have and whether they are introduced at the very beginning of cooking or just added at the end, as I’m going to do here. The inspiration for this recipe came when I was in Japan and saw mushrooms being cooked completely dry on a barbecue or griddle pan. This way of cooking brings out a really fresh and nutty flavour in them; perfect for being dressed lightly with olive oil, salt and lemon juice or stirred into a risotto at the last minute before serving.</i></li><li>Heat your stock in a saucepan and keep it on a low simmer. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl and pour in just enough hot stock to cover. Leave for a couple of minutes until they’ve softened. Fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid.</li><li>In a large pan, heat a lug of olive oil and add the onion and celery. Slowly fry without colouring them for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice. Give it a stir. Stir in the vermouth or wine – it’ll smell fantastic! Keep stirring until the liquid has cooked into the rice. Now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan and add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock. Turn the heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next.</li><li>Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. This will take about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until soft. If your pan isn’t big enough, do this in batches. Put them into a bowl and add the chopped herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice. Using your hands, get stuck in and toss everything together – this is going to be incredible!</li><li>Take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully. Stir in the butter and the Parmesan. You want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you think it needs it. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes.</li><li>Take your risotto and add a little more seasoning or Parmesan if you like. Serve a good dollop of risotto topped with some grilled dressed mushrooms, a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>I think it’s quite nice to have different shapes and sizes in a salad, so cut your medium tomato into wedges, halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the beef tomato into large rounds. Put all the tomatoes into a large salad bowl. Slice the onion very finely so it’s wafer thin and add to the tomatoes. Scratch a fork down the sides of the cucumber so it leaves deep grooves in the skin, then cut it into thick slices. Deseed your pepper, slice it into rings and add them to the salad along with the cucumber.</li><li>Roughly chop the dill and most of the mint leaves, reserving the smaller ones for garnish. Add the chopped herbs to the bowl of salad, then squeeze your handful of olives over so they season the vegetables, then drop them in.</li><li>Add a pinch of sea salt, the vinegar and the extra virgin olive oil. Quickly toss everything together with your hands. The minute all those flavours start working with the veg is when the magic starts to happen. Have a taste, and adjust the flavours if need be.</li><li>To serve, pop the block of feta right on the top of the salad.

I’ve gone for quite a delicious and delicate apple salsa here – give it a try.</i></li><li>Put the cornmeal and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Mix the baking powder into the hot water and pour this into the well. Using a fork, mix the cornmeal into the liquid, and when it starts to come together use your hands to knead it. Divide the dough into 16 equal squash-ball-sized pieces and dust them lightly with flour. Roll each piece around in your hands, then pat and flatten into a small round roughly the size of the base of a wine glass. Put these on an oiled tray, dust with flour and put aside while you make your salsa. </li><li>Finely chop your apple, tomatoes and spring onions, and finely slice your chilli. Put them all into a bowl. Pick the leaves from your coriander and put them into a bowl of water until you’re ready to serve. Chop the coriander stalks up nice and finely and add to the bowl with the other salsa ingredients.  Put a large pan on a medium heat and add your pumpkin and sunflower seeds. Toss them around for a few minutes and toast them. Add them to your salsa with the juice of your lime, a good lug of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Bring a pan of water to a fast boil, add your beans, put a lid on the pan, and cook for at least 4 to 5 minutes. Boiling the beans fast like this helps them to retain all their nutrients. Meanwhile, put the mustard and vinegar into a jam jar or bowl and, while stirring, add the olive oil to make a good hot French dressing. Season carefully with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add the finely chopped shallot, the capers if you're using them and the garlic.</li><li>Remove one of the beans from the pan to check if it's cooked. If it holds its shape but is also soft to the bite, it's perfect. Drain in a colander. Now, while the beans are steaming hot, this is the perfect moment to dress them – a hot bean will take on more of the wonderful dressing than a cold one. It is best to serve the beans warm, not cold, and certainly not at fridge temperature because the flavours will be muted and boring. Serve the beans in a bowl, sprinkled with chervil if you like – it's a delicate, crunchy herb that goes well with beans. Serve as a salad in its own right, or as an accompaniment to a main meal.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>When I took my students to Italy to see how olive oil was made, we ate these ‘fried’ pizzas at a great little restaurant called Il Vescovino in Panzano in the Chianti region. The chef fried the thin bases in oil, like poppadoms, then quickly topped them with tomato sauce, mozzarella and a little bit of oregano and popped them straight under a hot grill. They were the lightest pizzas I've ever eaten – just incredible – and this is how the first ever pizzas were made.<br/>
</i><br/>
First, make your <a href="/recipes/bread-recipes/pizza-dough/">basic pizza dough</a>. Now make your tomato sauce. Heat a saucepan, add a splash of oil and the sliced garlic and cook gently. When the garlic has turned light golden, add half the basil, the tomatoes and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Cook gently for about 20 minutes, mashing the tomatoes until smooth, then taste, season again and put to one side.</li><li>Preheat your grill to its highest temperature. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and press them flat on to a floured work surface. Heat a frying pan over a high heat, add about 2cm of vegetable oil and fry each pizza for 30 seconds or so on each side. Remove with tongs and place on a baking tray.</li><li>Once all the bases are fried, smear each one with a spoonful of the tomato sauce and tear over some mozzarella and a leaf or two of basil or dried oregano.

Thinly slice the pineapple, and dust the slices with icing sugar.</li><li>Make sure the bars of the barbecue are clean – especially if you’ve been cooking fish or meat beforehand – and drop the slices of pineapple on to it.

Using a fine grater, zest your clementines over the figs then dust the figs with a sprinkling of cinnamon and a teaspoon of sugar. </li><li>Pop the figs in the oven to bake for 4 hours, checking on them every hour or so. When they come out of the oven you’ll have semi-dehydrated figs, which will be a bit like wine gums. </li><li>A really nice way of using them at Christmas is to turn them into a bit of a gift by popping a stack of them in a sterilised jar, covering them completely with honey then sealing the jar with an airtight lid. They’ll be beautiful as part of a cheese platter, baked in a tart, a sticky toffee pud, or even thrown into a roasting tray with some pork or other meat for a bit of added sweetness. Give them to your mates when you go round to theirs for dinner. They’ll love getting something unique, especially when you explain all the different things they can do with them.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>Farro is a grain similar to pearl barley, but it’s dried in such a way that instead of being fluffy and spongy it becomes chewy and nutty. You may have difficulty getting hold of it, but if you can find it you’ll be using it all the time – it has an unusual flavour half-way between rice and couscous (this recipe will also work well with both of these). In Italy it was a major food for the ancient Romans, who used it to make bread, porridge and soup before they got hold of wheat. Nowadays it’s used in salads, soups, stews, even pastas. You should be able to buy farro in good Italian delis, and supermarkets have started to stock it in the special selection aisles. Here’s a recipe for one of my fave salads – give it a go.</i></li><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Soak the farro or bulgar wheat in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain. Slice the courgettes across into chunky half-moons and put them into a large roasting tray. Add the remaining vegetables and the garlic cloves and toss together with a good splash of olive oil. Season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt. Try to spread the vegetables out in one layer, as they’ll roast better this way (use 2 trays if you have to). Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, removing the trays and carefully shaking them now and then, until the vegetables are cooked through and crisp around the edges. Sprinkle a little vinegar over the vegetables as soon as they come out of the oven and set aside to cool. When cool, tip on to a large chopping board, add the fresh herbs and chop finely.</li><li>Place the farro or bulgar wheat in a large saucepan, cover with fresh cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender, and drain well. Dress with olive oil and the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and toss with the roasted herby vegetables. Scatter over the reserved fennel tops and serve.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel and crush the garlic, peel and slice the onions and shallots. Trim, wash and slice the leeks.</li><li>Put the butter, 2 lugs of olive oil, the sage leaves (reserving 8 for later) and the crushed garlic into a thick-bottomed, non-stick pan. Stir everything round and add the onions, shallots and leeks. Season with sea salt and black pepper.</li><li>Place a lid on the pan, leaving it slightly ajar, and cook slowly for 50 minutes, without colouring the vegetables too much. Remove the lid for the last 20 minutes – your onions will become soft and golden. Stir occasionally so that nothing catches on the bottom. Having the patience to cook the onions slowly, slowly, gives you an incredible sweetness and an awesome flavour, so don’t be tempted to speed this bit up.</li><li>When your onions and leeks are lovely and silky, add the stock. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. You can skim any fat off the surface if you like, but I prefer to leave it because it adds good flavour.</li><li>Preheat the oven or grill to maximum.</li><li>Toast your bread on both sides. Correct the seasoning of the soup. When it’s perfect, ladle it into individual heatproof serving bowls and place them on a baking tray.</li><li>Tear toasted bread over each bowl to fit it like a lid. Feel free to push and dunk the bread into the soup a bit. Grate over some of the Cheddar and drizzle over a little Worcestershire sauce.</li><li>Dress your reserved sage leaves with some olive oil and place one on top of each slice of bread. Put the baking tray into the preheated oven or under the grill to melt the cheese until bubbling and golden. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn’t burn! When the cheese is bubbling, very carefully lift out the tray and carry it to the table. Enjoy.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Whether you are using fresh or frozen peas, for 4 people you need to put 4 good handfuls of peas into a wide frying pan or casserole-type pan which has a lid (or you can use tinfoil), with ½ a wineglass of white wine, ½ a wineglass of water and 2 good knobs of butter. Place the lid on top and bring to the boil, then remove the lid and simmer for a minute or two while you finely slice a handful of mint leaves. With this reasonably small amount of liquid, the butter and wine should form a fantastically simple sauce. Throw in the mint at the last minute and serve straight away. Don't forget that it only takes a handful of grated Parmesan cheese and some cooked tagliatelle to turn these peas into a wonderful pasta dish. Or you can add them to a risotto, or whiz them up with some chicken stock to make a fine pea soup.</li></ol>]

Check the consistency – you want it to be the thickness of double cream. If it’s too thick, whisk in the rest of the beer. Don’t worry too much about having little lumps in the batter, as they’ll just become nice crunchy bits when you start frying. Season with sea salt and put to one side.</li><li>Trim the bottom off the stalk and break the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Slice up the stalk into 2cm pieces – this way it will all cook at the same rate. Place the cauliflower pieces in a bowl and dust with a little flour.</li><li>Pour the oil into a deep saucepan – you want it to be about 10–12cm deep – and heat it to 180°C. If you don’t have a thermometer don't worry, just drop a piece of potato into the oil. When it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, the oil will be at the right temperature so remove the potato from the pan.</li><li>Shake any excess flour off the cauliflower. One by one, dip the pieces into the beer batter, then carefully place them in the hot oil, moving them away from you as you do so. Make sure you stand back so you don’t get splashed. It’s best to fry them in batches so you don’t overcrowd the pan (but serve them as soon as each batch is ready).</li><li>Each time a batch of cauliflower is nearly ready, add some battered parsley leaves to the pan and fry for 40 seconds (you want to serve them scattered over the fritters). Fry the pieces gently, turning them a couple of times with a slotted spoon. </li><li>When they’re browned and crisp, lift them out of the oil, allowing any excess to drip back into the pan, and drain on kitchen paper. Dust with sea salt and squeeze over a little lemon juice.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Make the dressing by squeezing the lemon juice into a clean jam jar, topping up with 10 tablespoons of oil, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. </li><li>Secure the lid on the jar, give it a good shake, and put aside until needed.</li><li>Peel and slice the pears and beets into fine matchsticks – if your knife skills aren’t up to speed yet, use a matchstick peeler, mandolin (use the guard!) or box grater.</li><li>Dress the matchsticks in a little of the lemon oil dressing (keep the rest in the fridge for another day) – taste to check that the flavours are balanced, then adjust the seasoning, if needed.</li><li>Divide the salad between plates or place on a serving platter, then crumble over the creamy feta.</li><li>Pick and roughly chop the mint leaves, then sprinkle over the salad with the sunflower seeds (if using).</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>This is a fantastic and really unusual salad that was inspired by a friend of mine called Das who runs the most terrific Indian restaurants in London, called Rasa. Although I have called it ‘Keralan’, it isn't really a true salad from there as you'd never find cress in Kerala! </i></li><li>In Rasa, Das uses a lot of fresh coconut – which really is one of the most incredible flavours for making dishes like curries, or mixed into rice, breads, desserts and salads. You can now buy coconuts from most supermarkets, but if you can't find one, feel free to make this salad without it – it will still be pretty good but it won't have that special edge to it. Only make this when the mangoes are silky smooth and not at all stringy. You should be able to cut through them like butter.<br/>
</li><li>First of all you need to crack open the shell of the coconut. I normally do this by placing it on a tea towel on a hard surface and then giving it a wallop with a rolling-pin or a hammer. Once you've cracked it open you can pull it apart (being careful not to spill the milk everywhere!), discarding the hard outer shell. The dark skin on the outside of the coconut's flesh doesn't bother me, especially if I'm grating it. But if you want to remove it, a speed peeler works quite well.</li><li>Once you've got into your coconut, cut the peppers into quarters, remove the stalks and seeds, then finely slice. Trim your cress directly from its punnet (the easiest way to do this is to take the cress out of the punnet, wash the leafy end and stalks under a tap, then slice the stalk end off and discard it). Trim your spring onions and finely slice them. Cut the mango flesh off the stones and finely slice it (there is a knack to doing this properly – if you look at the shape of the mango, the flat stone always lies the same way, parallel with the flattest sides, so you should be able to slice the flesh off with not too much wastage). Get your pieces of coconut and grate them finely. Put all these ingredients into a large salad bowl.</li><li>Lime and ginger work together really well in the dressing. Finely grate the ginger and lime zest into a small bowl, then add the lime juice and olive oil. Season to taste, and add more oil as necessary to balance the flavours of your dressing. Limes can be different strengths depending on their juiciness and size.</li><li>Dress the salad just before serving, saving any extra dressing for another day, and eat straight away. Great just as it is, or with some grilled prawns or satay chicken. Also lovely as a snack inside a wrap or flatbread. So even though the coconut may be a pain to prepare it's well worth it...</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Take 3 large handfuls of cavolo nero, cabbage or Swiss chard and strip the leaves off the stalks. Add 3 cloves of peeled garlic to a pan of salted water and bring to the boil, then add the cavolo. Cook until tender, then drain well in a colander and allow to cool. Squeeze out any excess water from the cavolo, mush up the garlic, season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>These tasty, crispy tortillas with guacamole are superb for snacking on while you're watching telly. It's all quick and easy to rustle up.</i></li><li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.

Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, and pour into a serving dish. Brush the tortillas with the oil, season, and then sprinkle with the thyme leaves. Lay them on a baking tray – don't overlap them too much – and bake for 5 minutes until golden brown, then leave them to cool. Break into wedges if you like, and serve the crispy tortillas with the guacamole.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Put all your ingredients into a jam jar with some sea salt and black pepper. Shake, taste and season again if needed until your dressing is perfect. You may need to add a little more vinegar or oil to balance it.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Chop the tips off your asparagus and put these to one side for later. Roughly chop the asparagus stalks.</li><li>Get a large, deep pan on the heat and pour in a good lug of olive oil. Gently fry the onions, celery and leeks for around 10 minutes, or until soft and sweet, without colouring.</li><li>Add the chopped asparagus stalks and stock and simmer for 20 minutes with a lid on. Remove from the heat and blitz with a hand-held blender or in a liquidizer. Season the soup bit by bit (this is important) with salt and pepper until just right.</li><li>Put the soup back on the heat, stir in the asparagus tips, bring back to the boil and simmer for a few more minutes, or until the tips have softened.</li><li>Just before I’m ready to serve the soup, I get a wide casserole-type pan on the heat with 8 to 10cm of boiling water. Using really fresh eggs, I very quickly crack all 10 into the water. Don’t worry about poaching so many at the same time. They don’t have to look perfect. A couple of minutes and they’ll be done, as you want them to be a bit runny.</li><li>Toast your ciabatta slices. Using a slotted spoon, remove all the poached eggs to a plate and add a knob of butter to them. </li><li>To serve, divide the soup between eight warmed bowls and place a piece of toast into each. Put a poached egg on top, cut into it to make it runny, season and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>This is quite an unusual salad and terribly simple to make. It's great because it's a nice little side dish that will go with things like mozzarella, goat's cheese, cured meats, grilled or barbecued white fish like cod or haddock, even things like chicken or pork. Use courgettes when at their best (nice and firm and not too big).</i></li><li>Slice 4 courgettes lengthways as thin as you can (use a mandolin if you have one). Grill on a red-hot griddle pan, or on the barbecue, until lightly charred on each side. Scatter the slices over a large plate, making sure you don't sit them on top of each other otherwise they'll steam and go a bit limp, and there's nothing worse than limp courgettes, I can tell you. While they're still warmish, sprinkle them with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li><li>Deseed a red chilli and chop finely. Finely chop ½ a clove of garlic and sprinkle the chilli and garlic evenly from a height over the courgettes. (Add to your own taste, but just remember that when the chilli and garlic mix with the olive oil and lemon juice the heat and flavours are lessened.)</li><li>Tear over a handful of fresh mint and drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. I've even been known to throw in some blanched broad beans or raw peas if I can get any. This salad is always a real treat.</li><li>P.S. If you find yourself with leftovers, try baking any fish fillets (cod, haddock or bass for example) on top of the courgettes. Lovely with steamed rice and seasoned yoghurt. Very fresh and good for you.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Pull the leaves from the celery stalks and set them aside. Chop your celery and onion. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Add the celery (not the leaves), onion, and thyme. Stir until the vegetables start to brown. </li><li>Sprinkle the flour over the veggies and stir for a few more minutes. Pour in the milk, add the potato and bring to a boil, stirring the whole time so the soup doesn’t stick to the pot. Cook until the potatoes are tender, but not mushy – this will take around 10 minutes. </li><li>Meanwhile, chop the celery leaves, trim the ends off the spring onions and slice them thinly. When the potatoes are tender, stir in the corn, spring onion and celery leaves. Bring the soup back to the boil, then serve. </li><li>This is delicious with a crusty brown roll or a Parmesan crisp.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i> Beans are magical little things and massively underrated. I’m showing them some love by pairing them with exciting Mexican flavours. Baked in a tortilla with veg and cheese until golden on the outside, but oozy on the inside, it’s a real texture extravaganza. Beans are an amazing veggie source of protein and are packed with fibre, which will keep you nice and full. They also count as one of your 5-a-day, so this recipe clocks up up two of your 5-a-day! Use any leftover beans and tomatoes to make some homemade baked beans – add a pinch of paprika for a smoky kick.<i></i></i></li><li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/ gas 4. Peel and finely slice the onion, then deseed and slice up the pepper. Coarsely grate the cheese.</li><li>Heat a little oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat and gently fry the onion for 10 minutes, or until softened.</li><li>Peel and crush the garlic, then add to the pan along with the chilli powder.</li><li>Add the tomato purée and the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon as you go, then drain and add the kidney beans.</li><li>Cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper.</li><li>In a separate pan, fry the pepper in a little oil until starting to soften, then set aside.</li><li>Divide the filling mixture in half, then blitz one half with a stick blender to form a bean paste – if you don’t have a stick blender, mash with a potato masher.</li><li>Spread the tortillas with the warm bean paste, then add a serving spoon of the filling and sprinkle with cheese. Roll up the tortillas and place on greased baking tins.</li><li>Bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until golden and warmed through.</li><li>Dress the salad leaves in a little oil and vinegar, then serve alongside your bean wraps.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>This dish is only as good as the vegetables you buy, so use that as your starting point and you'll be on to an absolute winner! Here are some tips on buying and preparing a selection of veg...</li><li>In most supermarkets these days you can get fresh baby carrots with their green tops. Leave about an inch of the tops on and just give the carrots a scrub.</li><li>Do the same with some lovely radishes. You can get some marbled pink and white oval ones now, which are crunchy and peppery. Again, leave the tops on as these make good handles when it comes to dipping.</li><li>Use nice crunchy lettuces. Sweeter lettuces like cos and romaine are good for dipping – I try to use the inner part, keeping the outer leaves for another salad. I leave the stalk on and then cut the lettuce into quarters, and that way they stay in one piece, but you don't have to do this. The important thing is to get good chunks of vegetables. I like to contrast the sweet lettuces with slightly more bitter ones like radicchio or endive.</li><li>If you've got some young asparagus that's just come into season, it's really nice eaten raw. Feel free to use your imagination on the veggie side. Little fingers of celery or celeriac are also good. However, you often come across people who use raw cauliflower with dips – I personally would prefer colonic irrigation! I think cauliflower and broccoli are just awful eaten raw, so I wouldn't suggest using them here.</li><li>Put the yoghurt in a food processor, pick in the mint leaves and whiz up for half a minute or so. Add the peas and the Parmesan, and whiz again – the peas will break down and the yoghurt will become green. </li><li>Put the dip in a bowl, correcting the seasoning with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice. When you add the lemon juice and peas to the yoghurt, quite often it splits and turns into a kind of cheese, but this is absolutely fine. It depends on the type of yoghurt you use and how acidic your lemon is. Just pour away any excess water. Usually, though, it doesn't split and is more like a purée, but both ways are good.</li><li>Serve your veggies on a big board or in a big bowl next to the dip. And have some salt and pepper to hand in case you need it. It's a good sociable way to start a meal.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Boil the peas until perfect, then remove from the heat and drain in a colander, saving a small cup of the cooking water. Put the peas back in the pan with some of the reserved water and add a splash of olive oil. Stir around, then sprinkle in the Parmesan cheese and stir again until every single pea is lightly coated in the sweet, delicately melted cheese. You may need to add a bit more water to loosen the peas – you want them to be oozy (almost like a risotto consistency). A small squeeze of lemon juice always lifts the peas and cuts through the cheese, and a sprinkle of white pepper is nice too.</li><li>This dish is best made quickly at the very last minute as, like a risotto, the moment those peas begin to cool down, things start getting a little claggy and rubbery and you definitely don’t want that.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>If you want your chutney to last for a while, make sure you have some small sterilised jars ready to go.</li><li>Place your chillies and peppers over a hot barbecue, in a griddle pan or on a tray under a hot grill, turning them now and then until blackened and blistered all over.</li><li>Carefully lift the hot peppers and chillies into a bowl (the smaller chillies won’t take as long as the peppers so remove them first) and cover tightly with cling film. As they cool down, they’ll cook gently in their own steam. By the time they’re cool enough to handle, you’ll be able to peel the skin off easily. </li><li>When you’ve got rid of most of the skin, trimmed off the stalks and scooped out the seeds, you’ll be left with a pile of nice tasty peppers and chillies. Finely chop by hand or put in a food processor and whiz up. Then put to one side.</li><li>Heat a saucepan and pour in a splash of olive oil. Add the onions, rosemary, bay leaves and cinnamon and season with a little sea salt and black pepper. Cook very slowly for about 20 minutes, or until the onions become rich, golden and sticky.</li><li>Add the chopped peppers and chillies, the sugar and the vinegar to the onions and keep cooking. When the liquid reduces and you’re left with a lovely thick sticky chutney, season well to taste.</li><li>Remove the cinnamon stick and the bay leaves. Either spoon into the sterilised jars and put them in a cool dark place, or keep in the fridge and use right away. In sterilised jars, the chutney should keep for a couple of months.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat and add a good few lugs of olive oil. When the oil’s hot, add the garlic and chilli and fry until lightly coloured. </li><li>Drop in most of the basil – stand back as it will crackle and spit in the oil – and then, after a few seconds, add the tomatoes. Bring to the boil and simmer for about 5 minutes. You’ll end up with a chunky sauce – if you like it smoother, pass the sauce through a coarse sieve. Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. </li><li>Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. On a lightly floured work surface, cut the lasagne sheets into strips with a knife or a pastry wheel. When the water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta and cook for a few minutes until just al dente. </li><li>Drain the pasta strips in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water. </li><li>Stir the pasta into the warm sauce. If it’s a bit thick, add a few spoonfuls of the cooking water to loosen it up. Sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and the reserved basil leaves and serve immediately.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Mix the beaten egg with the milk and a dash of limoncello in a shallow dish. Dip the bread slices into the mixture and shake off the excess. </li><li>Sprinkle the slices with the caster sugar, then cook on the barbecue for a couple of minutes on each side until golden.</li><li>Dust the strawberries with caster sugar and grill them really quickly, just until the sugar on the outside browns.</li><li>Top the warm bread with ricotta and the grilled strawberries. Drizzle with honey and decorate with lemon zest.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li><i>The first time I ever made this was at the Neal Street Restaurant, and about two years later, when I was at the River Café, Rose Gray showed me her way of doing it. She inspired me to think of grilling as a really exciting way to prepare vegetables.</i></li><li>Wash all your vegetables. Heat the barbecue or a griddle pan, put your whole peppers on it, and get them really black on all sides. While still hot, put them in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool.</li><li>Slice your courgettes lengthways about 0.5cm thick and do the same with your fennel, reserving the herby tops. Grill the courgette and fennel together on the griddle pan for about a minute on each side or until nicely charred. You don’t want them too black or too raw. Transfer to a clean tea towel in one layer, making sure they don’t sit on top of each other, otherwise they will steam and go soggy.</li><li>Cut the aubergine across into slices 1cm inch thick. Every now and again you get an aubergine that is really seedy — if this happens, it will be bitter and no good, so throw it away and get yourself another one. Chargrill the aubergine slices, turning them 4 times until nicely marked, then transfer to the tea towel.</li><li>Boil the baby leeks in salted water until they’re just cooked. Then drain, rub with a little olive oil, and chargrill them quickly until lightly marked. </li><li>Peel the peppers but don’t hold them under the tap as all the sweet fantastic flavour will go down the drain. Carefully rub off the black skin, then remove the stalk and pips and tear the peppers up into large strips. Now put all the vegetables into a large bowl.</li><li>Take about a quarter of your basil leaves and bash them in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of seasoning until you have a smooth pulp. Add about 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, to taste. Pour this over the vegetables and toss quickly so that everything gets coated in the lovely basil oil, then throw in the remaining whole basil leaves. Slice the garlic really thinly to give you a delicate flavour and add to the bowl with the fennel tops. Mix everything together, and serve on a large plate at room temperature. Great with any grilled fish or meat, or as part of an antipasti plate with some toasted bruschetta and some fresh buffalo mozzarella.</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Wash the thyme stalks in hot water for 20 seconds. When cool enough to handle, strip the leaves off the stalk. In a food processor, whiz the thyme leaves, the cumin seeds and orange zest together with the butter. </li><li>Lay out a 30cm square piece of greaseproof paper on a work surface and scoop the butter on to the middle.

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>For the dough, pile the flours and 1 level teaspoon of sea salt onto a clean surface and make a well in the centre.</li><li>Add the yeast and sugar to 650ml lukewarm water, mix together and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well.</li><li>Using a fork and a circular movement, slowly bring in the flour from the inner edge of the well and mix into the water. Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour – when the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball.</li><li>Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough.</li><li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.</li><li>For the sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks.</li><li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on a medium-low heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li><li>Leave the sauce to tick away for around 20 minutes, or until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon. When the time’s up, taste, and season to perfection.</li><li>To assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half. Wrap one half in clingfilm and freeze for another day. With the remaining half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls.</li><li>Flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave to rest for about 15 minutes – this will make them easier to roll it thinly.</li><li>Dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about ½cm thick.</li><li>Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top. Continue doing the same with the remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile them up. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge.</li><li>When you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 250°C/500°F/gas 9.</li><li>At this stage you can apply your topping: spread the tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges. Tear over the mozzarella and scatter with the remaining basil leaves. Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and add a pinch of salt and pepper. </li><li>If you can, cook the pizzas on a piece of granite in your conventional oven – if not, cook them one by one on pieces of tin foil directly on the bars of the oven shelf, towards the bottom of the oven (If you're going to cook your pizzas on the bars of the oven, make sure they're not too big – otherwise they'll be difficult to manoeuvre). Cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the pizzas are golden and crispy.</li><li>Here are some of my favourite topping ideas:<br/>

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Stage 1: making a well<br/>
Pile the flour on to a clean surface and make a large well in the centre. Pour half your water into the well, then add your yeast, sugar and salt and stir with a fork.</li><li>Stage 2: getting it together<br/>
Slowly, but confidently, bring in the flour from the inside of the well. (You don't want to break the walls of the well, or the water will go everywhere.) Continue to bring the flour in to the centre until you get a stodgy, porridgey consistency – then add the remaining water. Continue to mix until it's stodgy again, then you can be more aggressive, bringing in all the flour, making the mix less sticky. Flour your hands and pat and push the dough together with all the remaining flour. (Certain flours need a little more or less water, so feel free to adjust.)</li><li>Stage 3: kneading!<br/>
This is where you get stuck in. With a bit of elbow grease, simply push, fold, slap and roll the dough around, over and over, for 4 or 5 minutes until you have a silky and elastic dough.</li><li>Stage 4: first prove<br/>
Flour the top of your dough. Put it in a bowl, cover with cling film, and allow it to prove for about half an hour until doubled in size – ideally in a warm, moist, draught-free place. This will improve the flavour and texture of your dough and it's always exciting to know that the old yeast has kicked into action.</li><li>Stage 5: second prove, flavouring and shaping<br/>
Once the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out for 30 seconds by bashing it and squashing it. You can now shape it or flavour it as required – folded, filled, tray-baked, whatever – and leave it to prove for a second time for 30 minutes to an hour until it has doubled in size once more. This is the most important part, as the second prove will give it the air that finally ends up being cooked into your bread, giving you the really light, soft texture that we all love in fresh bread. So remember – don't fiddle with it, just let it do its thing.</li><li>Stage 6: cooking your bread<br/>
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Very gently place your bread dough on to a flour-dusted baking tray and into the preheated oven.  Don't slam the door or you'll lose the air that you need. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until cooked and golden brown. You can tell if it's cooked by tapping its bottom – if it sounds hollow it's done, if it doesn't then pop it back in for a little longer. Once cooked, place on a rack and allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes – fandabidozi. Feel free to freeze any leftover bread.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Mix everything together in a bowl and season to taste.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Rub each potato with a little olive oil, then place in a large baking dish. Bake for 1 hour, or until the potatoes are golden and tender. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Leave the oven on.</li><li>Cut the baked potatoes in half, then use a teaspoon to scoop out the middle into a bowl – leave a bit of potato around the edges so the baked potato keeps its shape. Mash the potato with a fork. Chop half the rocket, then add to the potato with the Gorgonzola. Season with pepper (the Gorgonzola will provide the salt) and mix together. Spoon back into the potato skins.</li><li>Place the potato skins on a couple of baking trays and bake in the oven for 10 minutes, to warm through and melt the cheese. Transfer to a serving plate and top with the remaining rocket dressed with extra virgin olive oil. Add a little blob of chopped mustard fruit, if using. Serve while still warm.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat the oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7. </li><li>Wash your potatoes and parboil until almost tender, then drain. </li><li>Pick and bash the rosemary leaves.</li><li>Drizzle with just a little touch of oil and roll in a teaspoon of sea salt, a little freshly ground black pepper and the rosemary. </li><li>Put the potatoes in a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 25 minutes until golden. Or, wrap them in tin-foil and throw them on the barbie for the same amount of time.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Start by preparing the artichokes: peel them back to their pale, light leaves, then halve them and remove the hairy chokes with a teaspoon. </li><li>Place the prepped artichokes in a pan with just enough water to cover them. Add the unpeeled garlic cloves and a little squeeze of lemon juice and cook until the stalks are tender. </li><li>Drain in a colander, then place the artichokes straight back into the empty pan with 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry for 4 minutes to get a bit of colour on them. </li><li>When they're slightly golden, remove from the heat, squeeze in a little lemon juice, pick, roughly chop and add the mint leaves, then season carefully to taste with sea salt and black pepper. </li><li>Remove 4 artichoke halves from the pan and put to one side, then mash all the rest in the pan, using a fork to squash the garlic out of the skins (throw the skins away). </li><li>For the basic bruschette, cut the loaf in half, then slice it crossways, about 1cm thick. </li><li>Chargrill these slices on a barbecue or in a griddle pan until they are crisp on both sides, then lightly rub each piece a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic. </li><li>Drizzle with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a tiny pinch of sea salt. </li><li>Spread the mashed artichokes over the basic bruschette, tearing one of the reserved artichoke halves over the top of each.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Preheat a griddle pan or barbecue.</li><li>Trim and slice the aubergines 1cm thick. Peel and finely chop the onion, and peel and finely slice the garlic.</li><li>Place a large pan on a medium heat with 2 or 3 lugs of olive oil, add the onion, garlic and dried oregano, then cook for 10 minutes, or until the onion is soft and the garlic has a tiny bit of colour. </li><li>If you’re using tinned tomatoes, break them up, and if you’re using fresh tomatoes (which will obviously taste sweeter and more delicious, if they’re in season), very quickly prick each one and put them into a big pan of boiling water for 40 seconds. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and put them into a bowl of cold water for 30 seconds, then remove the skins, carefully squeeze out the pips and cut up the flesh. </li><li>Add the tomato flesh or tinned tomatoes to the onion pan, give the mixture a good stir, then put a lid on and simmer slowly for 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. </li><li>Grill the aubergines on both sides until lightly charred – you'll need to work in batches.</li><li>Season the tomato sauce carefully with sea salt, black pepper and a tiny swig of wine vinegar, then pick in the basil. You can leave the sauce chunky or you can purée it.</li><li>Spoon a layer of tomato sauce into a 15cm x 25cm baking dish, then add a fine scattering of Parmesan, followed by a single layer of aubergines. Repeat these layers until you’ve used all the ingredients up, finishing with a little sauce and another good sprinkling of Parmesan. </li><li>Pick and finely chop the oregano, then toss with the breadcrumbs and a little olive oil, then sprinkle on top of the Parmesan. Tear over the mozzarella (if using).</li><li>Bake at 190°C/375°F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, or until golden, crisp and bubbly – it’s best eaten straight away, but it can also be served cold.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Heat a griddle pan until nice and hot. Lay your aubergine slices on it side by side and when they are nicely charred on both sides, put them into a bowl. You will probably need to do this in several batches. </li><li>While the aubergines are grilling, put 8 tablespoons of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of vinegar, with the parsley, mint and garlic, into another bowl and season with salt and pepper. </li><li>When the aubergines are all done, add them to the dressing and mix around, then check the seasoning again and divide on to the <a href="/recipes/bread-recipes/bruschetta/">bruschetta</a>. Press the topping into the toast so all the lovely flavour gets sucked in!</li></ol>]

[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel the artichokes back to their pale, light leaves, then halve them and remove the hairy chokes with a teaspoon. Immerse the artichokes in water with half the lemon juice, with a heavy lid or heat-resistant dish placed on top of them to keep them immersed and stop them discolouring.</li><li>Start your <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/rice-recipes/risotto-bianco-white-risotto">risotto bianco</a> and when you begin stage 3, drop 6 of your prepared artichoke halves into the simmering stock. Continue cooking the risotto, adding the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is half-cooked. </li><li>Slice the remaining artichoke halves very finely and stir into the risotto. Continue stirring the stock into the rice. At stage 4, when the rice is cooked and you have added the butter and Parmesan, stir in the rest of the lemon juice. Take the pan off the heat and check the seasoning.</li><li>Pick and tear up the mint leaves. Remove the cooked artichokes from the stock pan and toss with most of the lemon zest, the torn-up mint leaves and a splash of olive oil. </li><li>Spoon the risotto onto 4 plates and place the dressed artichokes on top. Drizzle with any remaining dressing from the bowl and serve sprinkled with extra Parmesan and the rest of the lemon zest.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>First make your <a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/rice-recipes/a-basic-risotto-recipe">basic risotto recipe</a>, then put a large saucepan on a medium to high heat and pour in half the stock, followed by all your risotto base. Stirring all the time, gently bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer until almost all the stock has been absorbed. Add the rest of the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is cooked. You might not need all your stock. Be careful not to overcook the rice – check it throughout cooking to make sure it’s a pleasure to eat. It should hold its shape but be soft, creamy and oozy. And the overall texture should be slightly looser than you think you want it.</li><li>Turn off the heat, beat in your butter, Parmesan, gorgonzola, goat’s cheese, chopped apple and marjoram. Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed. Put a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute so the cheese can really ooze into it. While you’re waiting, gently heat the walnuts in a pan. Then either take the risotto to the table and let everyone help themselves, or divide it between individual serving plates. Put a block of Parmesan on the table for grating over. Sprinkle with the walnuts and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil before tucking in.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Heat a griddle pan until it’s really smoking hot, then griddle each slice of ciabatta for a couple of minutes on each side until they are nicely charred. </li><li>Cut the garlic clove in half, rub each ciabatta slice with garlic and drizzle with a little olive oil. </li><li>Tear the mozzarella evenly over the 8 crostini. </li><li>Season well with salt and pepper, sprinkle over the sliced chilli and basil leaves and grate over the lemon zest. Finish with another drizzle of olive oil.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Smash up the garlic with 1 teaspoon of salt in a pestle and mortar (or use the end of a rolling pin in a metal bowl). Place the egg yolk and mustard in a bowl and whisk together, then start to add your oils bit by bit. Once you’ve blended in a quarter of the oil, you can start to add the rest in larger amounts.  When the mixture thickens, add lemon juice. When all the oil has gone in, add the garlic and any extra flavours (see above). To finish off, season to taste with salt, pepper and a bit more lemon juice, if needed.</li><li>Try this: Lemon -or basil- flavoured aioli is good with salads, all types of fish, and in seafood soups. It's also great with roasted fish, chicken or pork, and is a classic with salmon.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Peel and finely slice the garlic.</li><li>Get a large pan of salted water on the boil. Melt the butter in a large ovenproof saucepan over a low heat, then add the flour and turn the heat up to medium, stirring all the time, until you get a paste – this is your roux. </li><li>Add all the sliced garlic – don’t worry about the amount because each slice will caramelise like toffee in the roux. Keep cooking and stirring until golden and the garlic is nice and sticky. </li><li>Add the bay leaves and slowly whisk in the milk a little at a time to ensure you get a nice smooth sauce. Bring the mixture to the boil, then leave it on a low heat to simmer and tick away, stirring occasionally. </li><li>Preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7.</li><li>Add the pasta to the pan of boiling salted water and cook according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, roughly chop the tomatoes on a board and season them well with sea salt and black pepper. Grate the Cheddar and Parmesan.</li><li>Drain the pasta and add it immediately to the sauce. Give it a good stir and take the pan off the heat. Stir in your grated cheeses, chopped tomatoes and pick in half of the thyme leaves. A little Worcestershire sauce added now is nice, and so is a little grating or two of nutmeg. Now work on the flavour – taste it and season it until it’s hitting the right spot. You want it to be slightly too wet because it will thicken up again in the oven, so add a splash of water if needed.</li><li>If you’ve made your sauce in an ovenproof casserole-type pan, leave everything in there; if not, transfer it to a deep earthenware dish. Bake it for 30 minutes in the oven, until golden, bubbling, crispy and delicious.</li><li>While it’s cooking, put your breadcrumbs and the rest of the the thyme leaves into a pan with a few drizzles of olive oil over a medium heat. Stir and toss the crumbs around until crunchy and golden all over. Remove from the heat and tip into a nice bowl. </li><li>Serve your macaroni cheese in the centre of the table, with your bowl of crispy breadcrumbs for sprinkling over, and a lovely green salad.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Heat the stock. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, trim and finely chop the celery. Finely grate the Parmesan.</li><li>In a separate pan, heat the oil and 1 small knob of butter over a low heat, add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. </li><li>Add the rice and turn up the heat – the rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. After 1 minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring — it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence.</li><li>Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of sea salt. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn’t cook too quickly on the outside. </li><li>Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and almost massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take around 15 minutes. Taste the rice — is it cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don’t forget to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water.</li><li>Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 knob of butter and the Parmesan, then stir well. </li><li>Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes – this is the most important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes outrageously creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as possible, while the risotto retains its beautiful texture.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Place the flour on a board or in a bowl. Make a well in the centre and crack the eggs into it. Beat the eggs with a fork until smooth.</li><li>Using the tips of your fingers, mix the eggs with the flour, incorporating a little at a time, until everything is combined. </li><li>Knead the pieces of dough together – with a bit of work and some love and attention they’ll all bind together to give you one big, smooth lump of dough!  </li><li>You can also make your dough in a food processor if you’ve got one. Just bung everything in, whiz until the flour looks like breadcrumbs, then tip the mixture on to your work surface and bring the dough together into one lump, using your hands.</li><li>Once you’ve made your dough you need to knead and work it with your hands to develop the gluten in the flour, otherwise your pasta will be flabby and soft when you cook it, instead of springy and al dente. </li><li>There’s no secret to kneading. You just have to bash the dough about a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, pulling it, stretching it, squashing it again. It’s quite hard work, and after a few minutes it’s easy to see why the average Italian grandmother has arms like Frank Bruno! You’ll know when to stop – it’s when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky instead of rough and floury.</li><li>Then all you need to do is wrap it in cling film and put it in the fridge to rest for at least half an hour before you use it. Make sure the cling film covers it well or it will dry out and go crusty round the edges (this will give you crusty lumps through your pasta when you roll it out, and nobody likes crusty lumps!).</li><li>How to roll your pasta:<br/>
First of all, if you haven't got a pasta machine it's not the end of the world! All the mammas I met while travelling round Italy rolled pasta with their trusty rolling pins and they wouldn't even consider having a pasta machine in the house! When it comes to rolling, the main problem you'll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with. It's quite difficult to get a big lump of dough rolled out in one piece, and you need a very long rolling pin to do the job properly. The way around this is to roll lots of small pieces of pasta rather than a few big ones. You'll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than the long rectangular shapes you'll get from a machine, but use your head and you'll be all right!</li><li>If using a machine to roll your pasta, make sure it's clamped firmly to a clean work surface before you start (use the longest available work surface you have). If your surface is cluttered with bits of paper, the kettle, the bread bin, the kids' homework and stuff like that, shift all this out of the way for the time being. It won't take a minute, and starting with a clear space to work in will make things much easier, I promise.</li><li>Dust your work surface with some flour, take a lump of pasta dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips. Set the pasta machine at its widest setting - and roll the lump of pasta dough through it. Lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks at all.</li><li>Click the machine down a setting and roll the pasta dough through again. Fold the pasta in half, click the pasta machine back up to the widest setting and roll the dough through again. Repeat this process five or six times. It might seem like you're getting nowhere, but in fact you're working the dough, and once you've folded it and fed it through the rollers a few times, you'll feel the difference. It'll be smooth as silk and this means you're making wicked pasta!</li><li>Now it's time to roll the dough out properly, working it through all the settings on the machine, from the widest down to around the narrowest. Lightly dust both sides of the pasta with a little flour every time you run it through.</li><li>When you've got down to the narrowest setting, to give yourself a tidy sheet of pasta, fold the pasta in half lengthways, then in half again, then in half again once more until you've got a square-ish piece of dough. Turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting. As you roll it down through the settings for the last time, you should end up with a lovely rectangular silky sheet of dough with straight sides - just like a real pro! If your dough is a little cracked at the edges, fold it in half just once, click the machine back two settings and feed it through again. That should sort things out.</li><li>Whether you're rolling by hand or by machine you'll need to know when to stop. If you're making pasta like tagliatelle, lasagne or stracchi you'll need to roll the pasta down to between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card; if you're making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini, you'll need to roll it down slightly thinner or to the point where you can clearly see your hand or lines of newsprint through it. </li><li>Once you've rolled your pasta the way you want it, you need to shape or cut it straight away. Pasta dries much quicker than you think, so whatever recipe you're doing, don't leave it more than a minute or two before cutting or shaping it. You can lay over a damp clean tea towel which will stop it from drying.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>Start by making a temper. Peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies, ideally 1mm thick on a mandolin (use the guard!).</li><li>Pour 2 tablespoons of oil into a large wide pan on a medium heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves for 1 minute, then the garlic and chillies. </li><li>Stir so everything’s flat, moving regularly until crisp and lightly golden. With a slotted spoon, remove half the temper to a plate, taking the pan off the heat.</li><li>Peel the onions and ginger and finely chop with the coriander stalks, then chop the squash into 2cm cubes, leaving the skin on but discarding any seeds. Stir it all into the pan and return to a medium heat for 15 minutes to soften. </li><li>Stir in the lentils, then 1.5 litres of boiling water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cover for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Mash the squash into the daal, taste and season to perfection. Remove 6 portions, bag them up and, once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day when you’ll be really grateful it’s there, leaving the rest on a low heat to keep warm. </li><li>Blitz the coriander leaves, yoghurt, a pinch of sea salt and half the lime juice in a blender until smooth, then decant into a small bowl. </li><li>Reheat the reserved temper in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat with 1 teaspoon of oil, then divide into two piles and crack an egg over each. Cover and leave to slowly fry on the bottom for 2 or 3 minutes, while they coddle on top. </li><li>One-by-one, puff up your dry poppadoms in the microwave for around 30 seconds each. </li><li>Top each portion of daal with a fried egg, and pop some spinach, dressing, poppadoms and a lime wedge on the side.</li></ol>]
[<ol class="recipeSteps"><li>First make the chutney. Squeeze the lime juice into a food processor and blitz with all of the other chutney ingredients (removing the chilli stalk) until smooth, adding a little water to loosen if needs be. </li><li>Pour the chutney into a small bowl and chill in the fridge while you make your fritters.</li><li>Place the gram flour, spices and mango powder in a large bowl and whisk in 150ml to 180ml of cold water until it forms a thin batter.</li><li>Cut the aubergines into 3mm rounds.</li><li>In a deep saucepan, pour in sunflower oil to a depth of at least 2.5cm and bring it to 180ºC over a medium heat – test this with a thermometer, or drop in a cube of bread and when it bubbles immediately the oil is ready.</li><li>Using metal tongs, dip each aubergine slice in the batter, shake off the excess, then slide it into the hot oil. Do this in batches and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp.</li><li>Carefully remove from the oil and leave to drain on kitchen paper, seasoning with sea salt while still hot.</li><li>Drop the curry leaves into the oil and fry for 30 seconds, or until crisp (be careful as the oil will spit). </li><li>Serve the fritters with the crispy curry leaves on top, a squeeze of fresh lime, and the coriander chutney on the side.</li></ol>]
