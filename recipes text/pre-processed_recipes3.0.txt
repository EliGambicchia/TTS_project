three obvious things are important on your journey to perfection – your choice of potato, your choice of oil and your choice of salt
 for me, the maris piper potato wins every time, and you want to use nice large ones
 on oil, sunflower and sunseed are very efficient, and many people swear by using groundnut oil
 but, if you’re after flavour, cooking chips in beef tallow 
 rendered beef fat you can get from your butcher
  gives you better flavour and colour – the choice is yours
 finally, on salt, being an essex boy, in my house it has to be maldon sea salt
so down to business: chop 800 grams of maris piper potatoes into finger-sized chips, leaving the skin on – don’t be too exact
 chip shops have massive industrial fryers, which you can’t recreate at home, so you need to use a large sturdy pan on a medium to high heat 
 unless you own a deep-fat fryer, of course
 your oil should be 8 centimetres deep, but never fill your pan more than half full
 if you don’t have a thermometer, use a raw chip, and as it starts to float and fry the temperature should be about 140°c, which is perfect for blanching
 use a large metal sieve to gently lower the chips into the pan for around 8 minutes, or until soft but not coloured, then remove to a tray to cool
turn the heat up under the oil and return one blanched chip to the oil as a guide again
 once it’s floating and golden the temperature should be about 180°c, which is perfect for frying and will give you chips with those all-important crispy outsides and fluffy middles
 at this stage you may want to cook your chips in 2-portion batches, so you don’t decrease the temperature of the oil too much or overcrowd the pan
 fry the chips until beautifully golden, then remove to a bowl lined with kitchen paper, shake around a bit, season with sea salt and serve right away

season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, then continue cooking for around 15 minutes, stirring occasionally
stir in the chopped basil leaves, then reduce to low and leave to tick away
 meanwhile…carefully fill a large pot three-quarters of the way up with boiling water, add a tiny pinch of salt and bring back to the boil
add the spaghetti and cook according to packet instructions – you want to cook your pasta until it is al dente
 this translates as ‘to the tooth’ and means that it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of a bite and firmness to it
 use the timings on the packet instructions as a guide, but try some just before the time is up to make sure it’s perfectly cooked
once the pasta is done, ladle out and reserve a cup of the cooking water and keep it to one side, then drain in a colander over the sink and tip the spaghetti back into the pot
stir the spaghetti into the sauce, adding a splash of the pasta water to loosen, if needed
serve with the reserved basil leaves sprinkled over the top and use a microplane to finely grate the parmesan cheese, then sprinkle over

melt the 100 grams of butter and leave it to cool
crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk and whisk to combine
 add the cooled melted butter and gradually stir it through the mixture
 it’s important not to stir the mixture any more after this or your waffles may be tough
place your griddle pan over a high heat, add the extra teaspoon of butter and as soon as it’s melted pour in the waffle batter and spread it around to fill the pan
 you could also make smaller waffles, if you prefer – you’ll need to do 2 at a time
lower the heat to medium-low and cook the waffles for around 6 minutes, or until lightly golden on the bottom
 flip over and continue to cook for around 6 minutes, until golden and cooked through
 it can be tricky to flip a whole waffle, but be bold and go for it – if it breaks, don’t worry, you can rock the rustic look
 give the waffle an extra couple of minutes on each side to crisp up, then serve them with your toppings
 i like mine with bacon, egg and maple syrup, but you can serve them with berries and yoghurt, or whatever you like

serve with a fresh green salad and some flatbreads or pittas
soak the corn 
 husks and all
  in cold water for at least 30 minutes – if you can’t find cobs with the husks intact, you don’t need to do this
 meanwhile, place the mayo into a bowl with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, the zest from the limes and the juice from 1
 mix well, taste and add a squeeze more juice, if needed
 spread the mayo onto a plate, then dust with the paprika or cayenne pepper and put to one side
 grate the cheese onto another large plate, then set aside also
preheat a griddle pan over a high heat
 add the corn and griddle for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the husks are black and charred all over, turning occasionally – the husks will help to steam the corn until tender
peel back the husks, keeping them intact at the base, then roll each cob into the lime-spiked mayo, before rolling into the cheese
 shake off any excess and get stuck in
you won’t believe how tasty the courgettes get with this method of cooking – it really does take them to another level
 you’ve got to find some lincolnshire poacher, it’s an amazing cheese made by the very talented jones brothers, simon and tim
 the pastry is rich and amazing, so embrace the fact that it’s really crumbly and will definitely break as you’re making it
 i’m serving this with a lemony salad and sweet salt-baked shallots, which will get caramelized and gorgeous and pick up the seasoning from the bed of salt
 this method is also a great one for beetroots, so if you like this, try that
preheat the oven to 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit or gas 4
 blitz the flour and butter in a food processor with a pinch of salt and a few good pinches of pepper until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs
 tip on to a work surface, make a well in the centre and add 100 millimetres of cold water
 gently mix until it starts to come together, then – most importantly for a short, crumbly pastry – have the confidence to only just press, pat and almost hug it together to form a rough scruffy ball
 please don’t be tempted to knead the dough or it won’t be short and crumbly
 pop it into a floured bowl, cover with clingfilm and put into the fridge to chill while you make the filling
put a drizzle of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat and pick in the leaves from half the bunch of thyme
 add a few gratings of nutmeg, the zest of half the lemon, the sliced courgettes and a good pinch of salt and pepper
 cook gently 
 the courgettes will cook down and become easier to handle
 , stirring occasionally, for around 25 minutes
 then turn the heat down to low and cook for another 20 minutes, so the courgette mixture becomes dense and the flavours really intensify and sweeten
 allow to cool a little, finely chop and crumble in the cheese, then chop and add the mint leaves
 set aside
halve the pastry and roll each half into a circle just under one centimetre thick and slightly larger than the pie dish you’ve chosen 
 roughly 23 centimetres diameter by 4 centimetres deep
 don’t worry if the pastry breaks up – that’s normal
 just patch it
 roll one of the circles around the rolling pin and carefully unroll it over the pie dish
 gently press the pastry into the corners and sides of the dish, then spoon and spread all your courgette mixture into the dish
 carefully unroll the pastry lid over the top, then flour your thumb and forefinger and gently pinch and crimp the edges together
 trim off any excess pastry and brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg
now simply throw the rock salt into a roasting tray with the shallots, still with their skins on, and a few thyme tips
 put the pie right at the bottom of the oven, with the tray of shallots above
 cook for 1 hour, or until the pie is golden, then allow to cool and serve with those soft roasted shallots
ps: all the leftover salt from baking the shallots can be bashed up and reused
add all the flatbread ingredients to a mixing bowl and mix together with a spoon, then use clean hands to pat and bring everything together
 dust a clean work surface with flour, then tip out the dough
knead for a minute or so to bring it all together 
 this isn’t a traditional bread recipe, so you don’t need to knead it for long – just enough time to bring everything together
 put the dough into a floured-dusted bowl and cover with a plate, then leave aside
if making the garlic butter: peel the garlic cloves and crush them with a garlic crusher
 pick the herb leaves onto a chopping board and finely chop them, discarding the stalks
 melt the butter in a small pan over a medium heat, then stir through the garlic and chopped herbs, then set aside
dust a clean work surface and rolling pin with flour, then divide the dough in half, then divide each half into 6 equal-sized pieces 
 roughly the size of a golf ball
 with your hands, pat and flatten the dough, then use a rolling pin to roll each piece into 12 centimetres rounds, roughly 2 millimetres to 3 millimetres thick
 use a knife to cut 6 lines into the centre of each round, leaving about 3 centimetres at each end
place the griddle pan on a high heat, then once hot, cook each one for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until bar-marked and puffed up, turning with tongs
 brush the flatbreads all over with herby garlic butter as they come off the griddle, then pile onto a serving board so everyone can dig in and help themselves
crack the eggs into a mixing bowl
 add the milk and season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper
 gently whisk the eggs and milk together with a fork, then put to one side
place the frying pan on a medium heat to heat up
 meanwhile…dip and push 1 slice of bread into the eggy mixture, turning it over a few times to make sure it’s well coated and sucks up the mixture like a sponge
 add half a tablespoon of olive oil to the frying pan and carefully swirl the pan around to evenly coat the inside
 lift the soaked bread up in the bowl and allow the excess mixture to drip off, then carefully lower it into the pan, making sure it’s facing away from you so you don’t get splashed with hot oil
cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through, using a fish slice to flip it over
 carefully lift the bread out of the frying pan and onto a serving plate using a fish slice
 place the pan back on the heat and repeat steps 6 to 10 with the remaining ingredients
crack the eggs into a measuring jug
 add a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then use a fork to beat them together well
 put a medium saucepan over a low heat and add the butter
 leave it to melt slowly, then when it starts to bubble carefully pour in the eggs
 stir slowly with a wooden spoon, or a spatula if you’ve got one, so you can get right to the edges of the pan
 keep gently stirring until the eggs still look silky, slightly runny and slightly underdone, and then remove from the heat – the heat of the pan will continue to cook the eggs to perfection
 serve with lightly buttered toast
preheat the oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 wash the potatoes under cold running water, scrubbing well with a scrubber to get rid of any dirt 
 there’s no need to peel them
on a chopping board, cut each potato in half lengthways, then cut each half in half lengthways, and then each piece in half again so you end up with 8 wedges, then add to a large mixing bowl
 sprinkle over a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and the paprika
 drizzle over 2 tablespoons olive oil, then toss everything together to coat
spread out into a single layer over two large baking trays, then bake in the hot oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through
 use oven gloves to remove the trays from the oven, then leave to sit for a couple of minutes 
 this will make it easier to remove them from the tray
 , then use a fish slice to transfer them to a serving dish
lightly rub a baking tray with some olive oil and put to one side
 put a large pan on a low heat and add your butter and sugar
 leave on a gentle simmer for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally to stop it catching, until the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture starts to darken
 gently stir in your pecans until they’re well coated in the caramel syrup
 be careful not to splash yourself, and don’t be tempted to have a taste because hot caramel can burn quite badly
 once coated, tip the nuts on to the oiled tray and use the back of a spoon to separate them out into one layer
 leave them to cool so the caramel can harden on the nuts
meanwhile, make your dressing
 grate the orange zest into a large salad bowl, squeeze in the juice and add the dijon mustard, white wine vinegar and a good lug of extra virgin olive oil
 whisk them, then have a taste – you want to get a nice balance between the sharpness of the vinegar and the smoothness of the oil, so add a little more oil if needed, then season carefully with sea salt and black pepper
click off the chicory leaves and wash and spin dry all your leaves
 core, quarter and finely slice your apples and add to the bowl with all your leaves
 break the cooled pecans apart, add half of them to the bowl, and use your hands to delicately toss and dress everything
 serve on one big platter, or divide up between plates, and finish by crumbling over the rest of your beautiful caramel pecans
crumpies are my new delicious invention and are a cross between a crumpet and a yorkshire pudding
 they can be whizzed together quickly, then poured into a yorkshire pudding mould and banged into the oven to get lovely and crisp on the top and bottom, and knotty, chewy and bubbly inside
 they’re perfect with butter, or whatever other lovely condiments you’ve got hanging around the cupboard
 my wife loves strawberry jam with hers, daisy loves marmite, poppy loves a drizzle of honey, and personally i like a little scrambled egg with a blob of ketchup or brown sauce 
 or both
  on the plate and, depending on how i feel, a little chilli sauce
preheat the oven to 170 celsius or 325 fahrenheit or gas 3 and grease a 12-hole muffin tin with some vegetable oil
 place all the other ingredients in a bowl with 2 teaspoons of sea salt and pour in 600 millimetres of tepid water
 the water needs to be warm enough to activate the yeast, but not so hot that it kills it
 whisk everything together until you’ve got a loose batter that is just combined – this should only take a few seconds
 leave to stand for 10 minutes to let the yeast do its job
 when the mixture is a spoonable, sticky consistency, but still quite wet, spoon it into the muffin tin
 fill each hole until it’s almost level with the top of the tin and cook for around 35 minutes, or until the crumpies are risen and golden
 remove to a wire rack for a few minutes to cool slightly, then serve while still warm with anything you fancy

pour in the tomatoes, using a spoon or potato masher to break them up
 bring to the boil, then turn down to a medium heat and cook for a further 5 minutes to reduce the sauce
when you’ve got a nice thick tomato stew consistency, have a taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed
slice the fresh tomatoes and lay them over the top of the mixture
use a spoon to make small wells in the tomato stew, then crack in the eggs so they poach in the thick, delicious juices – try to crack them in as quickly as you can so they all get to cook for roughly the same amount of time
 season from a height, put the lid on and let the eggs cook for around 3 to 4 minutes, or until cooked to your liking
 warm the tortillas while this is happening
 you can pop them into the oven at 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit or gas 4 for a few minutes, microwave them for a few seconds or even lay them over the lid of the pan so they heat up as the eggs cook
take the lid off and check your eggs by giving them a poke with your finger
 when they’re done to your liking, turn the heat off and take the pan to the table with the warmed tortillas, the cheddar and a grater so everyone can get involved and make their own
 personally, i like to grate a bit of cheese right on to a warm tortilla, spoon an egg and some of the wonderful tomato stew on top, wrap it up, and eat it right away
 what a beautiful way to wake up!this is one of the most delicious cornbreads i’ve ever had
 you get incredible flavour from the onions and sweetcorn, while the cornmeal gives it a rustic, spongy texture that’s so brilliant
 two of my favourites, chilli and cheese, do their thing in this bread and really take the flavour to a whole other level
 you can serve this cornbread alongside soups or stews, but frankly, i think a good slice of this, with a bit of crunchy salad, makes a brilliant lunch
 you could also reheat it in a dry pan the next day for breakfast and eat it with poached eggs and some smoky bacon 
 totally delicious

put 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the knob of butter into a separate pan, add the onion, garlic and celery, and cook very slowly for about 15 minutes without colouring
 this is called a soffrito
 when the vegetables have softened, add the rice and turn up the heat
the rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it

 keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next
 this will take around 15 minutes

 the toppings can be as humble or as luxurious as you like, from chopped herbs or a squashed tomato with basil, to marinated vegetables or beautiful cheeses, to lovely flaked crabmeat
 the only rule is that whatever goes on top of a bruschetta should be nice and fresh and cooked with care
make sure your tomatoes are really ripe when making this topping
 give them a wash, remove their cores and carefully squeeze out the seeds
 place in a bowl, tear in the basil, season with salt and pepper, then toss with a good glug of olive oil and a good swig of vinegar to balance the flavours to your taste
 you can serve the tomatoes either chunky or finely chopped, or you can scrunch them between your fingers before putting them on your basic bruschette – really tasty
this salad with radicchio is one of my favourite winter salads – the crispness of the bread, the saltiness of the feta cheese
 it comes with quite a sweet dressing which compliments the bitterness of the leaves perfectly
 a great little starter
 you don’t need to buy expensive balsamic vinegar for this one – the cheap stuff is fine as you’ll be reducing it into a lovely dressing
cut the radicchio into quarters
 grill in a dry, very hot griddle pan until nicely charred on all sides
 remove to a large bowl and griddle the slices of bread
 to make the warm dressing, fry the sliced garlic, pine nuts and raisins in a little olive oil
 when the garlic starts to colour, take the pan off the heat and pour in the balsamic vinegar
 most of the liquid will evaporate when it hits the hot pan, so you end up with a sticky dressing
 leave to cool a little
 roughly tear up the grilled radicchio and bread, and place back in the large bowl
 toss with the dressing, then squeeze out the dressing
 divide the radicchio and bread over your plates
 top with the rocket leaves, any pine nuts and raisins left in the bowl, and crumble the feta over the top

 stir in 150 millimetres of water and bring to the boil
 reduce to a medium heat and let the tomatoes cook for 5 minutes until they are slightly broken down
 if your tomatoes are nice and ripe they’ll be naturally sweet and soft, which means you won’t need to cook the soup for too long
 remove the soup from the heat, add a splash of red wine vinegar then carefully blitz with a hand blender until you get a consistency that’s to your liking
 serve in warm bowls with a spoonful of bright green basil oil swirled on top and sprinkled with the reserved basil leaves
 you can even eat any leftovers cold from the fridge for a really fresh, light soup
place the flours and half a tablespoon of sea salt into a large bowl, and make a well in the middle

 pop the basil and tomatoes into a bowl and season with sea salt and black pepper, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a tiny splash of white wine vinegar
 peel and slice the garlic and mix into the bowl
 to cook the focaccia, as soon as the dough has risen, pound it, then place on a baking tray and spread it out to cover the tray
 push down roughly on top of the dough like a piano to make lots of rough dips and wells
 divide the onion and the tomato toppings over two thirds of the focaccia
for the three-cheese and rosemary topping, break up the taleggio and the goat’s cheese over the remaining third of the focaccia
 grate a handful of parmesan cheese and pick the rosemary leaves
 sprinkle both over the final third and season with pepper
 finish with a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt
 leave to prove for a further 20 minutes, then bake for 20 minutes, until golden on top and soft in the middle
as kids love pasta and tomato sauce, this is an easy way to encourage them to try asparagus
 like the ‘full of veg’ tomato sauce you can always whiz the asparagus in a blender if you think they’ll be suspicious of the green bits
 the tomato does a good job of mellowing the flavour of the asparagus and once they’re used to eating it there are loads of wonderful dishes you can introduce them to

these gorgeous deep-fried mushrooms have the most unbelievable texture and make a brilliant starter or, even better, a simple snack

 allow the vinegar to steep for at least a few hours and, remember, the longer you leave it, the more delicious it will become
 you can let it infuse for a couple of weeks to really push up the flavour and, as long as you strain the vinegar after this time and bottle it up, you can keep using it for a good few months
 fill a deep pan with the olive oil and let it heat up over a medium heat
 meanwhile, put the flour on a large plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and the lemon zest
 cut or tear the mushrooms into uneven chunks, and sprinkle them with a bit of water to moisten them
 toss handfuls of the mushrooms in the seasoned flour until they are all lightly coated
 to test if the oil is hot enough, add a small piece of potato to the pan
 once it begins to sizzle and brown, the oil is ready
 deep-fry the mushrooms in batches – about a handful at a time - until they’re golden brown
 the cooking time will depend on the size of the mushrooms but it shouldn’t take more than 3 or 4 minutes – just use your instincts
 remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and leave on kitchen paper to drain for a minute
 serve as soon as possible sprinkled with a pinch of salt, some posh vinegar and some roughly chopped parsley
 delicious!place all the crumpet ingredients into a food processor, add 2 teaspoons of sea salt and 600 millimetres of tepid water and blitz to a loose batter

 mash half the raspberries with a fork and ripple through the ricotta
grease the inside of the metal rings with oil, then place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat – work in batches, according to the number of metal rings you have
 when the pan’s nice and hot, spoon some mixture into each ring, so it’s roughly one centimetre deep
 turn the heat down to low and leave for 15 minutes to cook through – keep an eye on them and reduce the heat slightly, if you think the bottoms are getting too dark
 when the time’s up, bubbles and crumpet-like dimples should have formed on the top — turn the crumpets over, using tongs to lift the rings away
 cook for another 5 to 10 minutes, or perfectly golden
serve the crumpets warm with a generous spoonful of ricotta, a scattering of fresh raspberries and an extra drizzle of honey, if you like

 gently melt the butter in a pan
 bash up the remaining coriander seeds
 brush a sheet of filo with some melted butter and sprinkle with a pinch of ground cinnamon and a little of the ground coriander
 cover with the second sheet, and brush and sprinkle as before
 repeat for the third sheet
 with a sharp knife, cut the stacked filo sheets into two 15 centimetres squares
  working quickly to prevent the pastry from drying, do the same with the remaining filo sheets
 you should now have four squares of filo
 place a generous tablespoon of the sweet potato mixture in the centre of each square and spread out slightly
  brush the edges of each square with water and fold in half, corner to corner, to make a triangle
 press down at the edges to seal
 brush both sides of each triangle with the rest of the melted butter, place on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven until light brown - this will take about 10 minutes

to prepare the artichokes, simply trim 5 centimetres below and above the base of the choke
 now what you need to do is trim back your artichoke leaves one by one, clicking them off until you get to the lovely paler yellow and more tender leaves
 using a pointed teaspoon, insert it right into the centre of the artichoke flower and slowly turn it to remove the fluffy choke
 have a little peer in and try to remove most of the choke
 rub the artichoke with lemon to stop it discolouring
 you'll get the hang of it when you do the rest
 you'll be left with 8 whole trimmed artichokes
preheat the oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 toss the garlic, almonds, breadcrumbs and herbs into a bowl, season, and loosen with a little olive oil
 scrunch together with your hands and stuff this mixture into the middle of each artichoke, really packing it in
 you want to fit these snugly side by side in an appropriately-sized baking dish
 sprinkle any excess filling over the top, drizzle generously with extra virgin olive oil and pour in your wine
 rip off a big enough piece of greaseproof paper, wet and scrunch it under a tap, then tuck it over the artichokes and round the edges of the dish
 bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove the greaseproof paper and bake for a final 10 minutes
 serve in the middle of the table with seafood or any white meat
heat the stock in a pan over a moderate heat
 heat the olive oil in a pan
 add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 5 minutes until softened
 add the rice to the pan and turn up the heat
 cook for a minute or so, stirring constantly, until the rice looks slightly translucent
 add the wine and keep stirring - any alcohol flavours will evaporate
once the wine has been absorbed by the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of salt and pepper
 turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside
 add the stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next, until the rice is cooked but still holds its shape - this takes about 15 minutes
stir in the appenzeller and taleggio
 remove the pan from the heat and season to taste, then beat in the butter and parmesan
 place a lid on the pan and leave to rest for 2 to 3 minutes - your risotto will get nice and oozy
 enjoy!place the porcini in a small dish, add boiling water just to cover, and leave to soak
 get a large casserole-type pan nice and hot, then add a good couple of lugs of olive oil and your fresh mushrooms
 stir around very quickly for a minute, then add your garlic, onion and thyme and a small amount of seasoning
 after about a minute you'll probably notice moisture cooking out of the mushrooms and at this point add half of your porcini, chopped up, and the rest left whole
 strain the soaking liquid to remove any grit, and add it to the pan
 carry on cooking for about 20 minutes until most of the moisture disappears
season to taste, and add your stock
 bring to the boil and simmer for around 20 minutes
 i usually remove half the soup from the pan and whiz it up to a purée at this point, then pour it back in, adding the parsley and mascarpone, and seasoning carefully to taste
you can serve this soup as you like, but there are a few things to remember when finishing it off
 mix together a pinch of salt and pepper with the zest of one lemon and the juice of half of it, then spoon a little of this into the middle of the soup
 when you go to eat it, stir it in and it gives a wonderful flavour
 other things you can consider are little slices of grilled crostini put into the bottom of the bowls before the soup is poured over
 or you could even quickly fry some nice-looking mushrooms – like girolles, chanterelles or oysters – and sprinkle these on top of the soup
 if i was going to use truffle oil, then i would use it on its own – a few drips on the top just before serving

when you halve the peaches, leave the stones in – they will come away a lot more easily after they have been cooked
 put them into a small pan with 4 tablespoons of the sugar, the cinnamon stick and the zest and juice of the orange
 put a lid on top and slowly simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the peach skin and stones can be easily removed
 you don't want to cook them to pulp – they should be soft but should still hold their shape
 remove from the heat and put to one side

 turn the heat up to medium, stir the rice, and add the wine, continuing to stir until it has almost cooked away
 now add the milk little by little
 keep the rice on a slow but constant simmer for about 16 or 17 minutes and stir it as often as you can
 in this way you can massage the starch out of the rice and this will give you a silky, oozy end product, much like the classic italian risotto
 when the rice has cooked through it should be soft yet still holding its shape
 you may need to add a little more milk or water just to adjust the consistency
 remove from the heat, add the grated white chocolate and the rest of the butter, then stir, place a lid on top and leave for a few minutes
remove the skin and stones from the peaches, discard them along with the cinnamon stick, and take the peaches to the table with your block of dark chocolate, snapped into small pieces

 by the time you go to eat it, the dark chocolate will have melted
 joy joy joy!a lot of people don’t realise that pea shoots are the best part of the pea plant to eat
 they make a wonderful salad ‘leaf’
 if you can’t get hold of them, then use a mixture of rocket and baby spinach leaves instead
 also, the point of this salad is that you use fresh, raw peas
 if you can’t get them, then make a different salad
add your peas and pea shoots to a bowl with the radicchio
 add the lemon juice and three times as much extra virgin olive oil
 season to taste with salt and pepper
 divide the salad between your plates and crumble over the cheese
 so simple, but so delicious!get your frying pan on a medium to low heat and add enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of a large nonstick pan 
 about 1 tablespoon
crack the eggs into the pan
 as the oil gets hotter you’ll see it start to change the color of the eggs
 if the oil starts to spit it’s because it’s too hot, so turn the heat right down
 cook until the tops of the whites are set but the yolk is still runny
when they’re ready, remove the pan from the heat and take the eggs out using a spatula
 place on a plate and dab them with some paper towels to soak up any excess oil
 serve on toast – no need to butter it – with a sprinkling of the sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
delicious served on some 7-grain bread
smash up half of the pine nuts to a paste, then put it into a big heatproof bowl with the rest of the whole pine nuts, the lemon juice and zest, the finely chopped parsley and the extra virgin olive oil
 stir and add the parmesan and pecorino
what you should have now is a reasonably thick sauce, which you should think of more as a dressing, so taste it and think about how the different flavours are coming through
 i want you to balance the flavours so you end up with something quite zingy because, as the sauce heats up and the cheese melts, the flavour of the lemon will calm down a lot
 season with some freshly ground black pepper
 taste it and if you think you haven’t got the balance right, simply add a little more oil and parmesan
put a large pot of salted water on to boil for your pasta
 sit the sauce bowl on top of the pan while the water’s heating up – this will take the chill out of the sauce and warm it through slightly
when the water starts to boil, remove the bowl and add your pasta to the water
 cook it according to the packet instructions then drain in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water
toss the pasta with the sauce and a little of the reserved cooking water to help loosen it up a bit
 the heat from the pasta will melt the cheese, allowing all the lovely sauce to coat it
 if you find the sauce is too thick then add a little more water
 it’s not supposed to be claggy, thick and miserable, but incredibly silky, fresh and fragrant
have one last taste to balance the flavours, and serve with a little extra parmesan shaved over the top and a sprinkle of parsley leaves
 eat immediately
cut the bigger tomatoes into slices about one centimetre inch thick
 you can halve the cherry tomatoes or leave them whole
 then sprinkle them all with a good dusting of sea salt
 put them in a colander and leave them for 30 minutes
 what's going to happen here is that the salt will draw the excess moisture out of the tomatoes, intensifying their flavour
 don't worry about the salad being too salty, as a lot of the salt drips away
place the tomatoes in a large bowl and dress with enough extra virgin olive oil to loosen 
 approximately 6 tablespoons
 , and 1–2 tablespoons of vinegar, but do add these to your own taste
 toss around and check for seasoning – you may or may not need salt but will certainly need pepper
 add the garlic
 now start to add the horseradish
 stir in a couple of teaspoons to begin with, toss around and taste
 if you like it a bit hotter, add a bit more horseradish
 all i do now is get some finely sliced flat-leaf parsley 
 stalks and leaves
  and mix this into the tomatoes
 toss everything together and serve as a wonderful salad, making sure you mop up all the juices with some nice squashy bread
this salad is fantastic with roast beef, goat's cheese or jacket potatoes
 and to be honest, even if you put these tomatoes in a roasting tray and roasted them with some sausages scattered around them it would be nice
in summer, a light pea soup feels totally right – the watercress in this recipe adds a mustardy bite
heat a large saucepan and pour in a little olive oil
 throw in the chopped onion and celery
 turn the heat down and cook very gently with the lid on for 10 minutes, or until the onion has softened, but not browned
 add the potato and stock and bring to the boil
 simmer for 10 minutes or until the potato is cooked
 next, drop in the peas and watercress and simmer for a further 5 minutes until the peas are cooked
 remove the pan from the heat
 whiz the soup with a hand blender, or in a liquidizer, until smooth
 taste, then season with salt and pepper
 serve the soup with a spoonful of soured cream swirled in, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some crusty bread and butter
 tip: you can use frozen peas – just simmer them in the stock a couple of minutesfirst of all, finely slice your red onion
 once that's done, finely slice your chillies then roughly chop your tomatoes, mixing them in with the onion and chillies
 scrape all of this, and the juice, into a bowl and dress with the juice of half a lemon and 3 tablespoons of good extra virgin olive oil
 season to taste
 heat the chickpeas in a pan, then add 90 per cent of them to the bowl
 mush up the remaining chickpeas and add these as well – they will give a nice creamy consistency
 allow to marinate for a little while and serve at room temperature
just as you're ready to serve, give the salad a final dress with the fresh mint and basil
 taste one last time for seasoning – you may want to add the juice from your remaining lemon half at this point
 place on a nice serving dish and crumble over the feta cheese
in palermo there's a night market called il borgo, where all the locals gather to eat at little stalls selling things like chickpea fritters, boiled baby octopus and some stuff that you wouldn't want to eat, like gizzards, spleen and other dirty wobbly things! a lot of the veg stalls have massive cauldrons of boiled potatoes and artichokes to serve to their customers – i guess you could say this is the original fast food – and they tasted absolutely brilliant
some of the stalls also make a version of this salad, which is absolutely delicious
 they tend to dress it and have it hanging around for quite some time so it becomes a bit sloppy and past its best, but the principle of the salad is fantastic and all the locals absolutely adore it
 in sicily you can get these terrific cedro lemons which are mainly pith and they are amazing in salads – but you may not be able to get hold of them
 in this case i wouldn't recommend you use normal lemons as the flavour is quite different
 the way potatoes are cooked in sicily is very long and very slow, on a low simmer with plenty of salt in the water
 this is a fantastic method of making normal potatoes soft and floury, but in the case of new potatoes it would be a crime
 so add them to fast-boiling salted water, as this will help retain a lot of their flavour, and cook them till nice and tender
 the softer you can get them while still holding their shape, the better
 while the potatoes are cooking, wash all your salad leaves and put them into a nice big bowl with the mint and fennel
 if using a cedro lemon, add the slices to the salad at this point
for the dressing, mix the orange juice and vinegar in a glass jar or bowl with about twice as much extra virgin olive oil
 add the oregano and capers and season to taste with salt and pepper
 give it a good mix and have a taste
 don't forget that you want the flavour to be a little over the top, so that by the time you've dressed the salad with it and it has mixed with all the other flavours it's perfect because it's become more subtle
 drain the potatoes when cooked, then allow them to steam in a colander for 5 minutes
 throw them into the salad while still warm and toss together well
 absolutely fantastic – great with a plate of grilled fish or as a lunchie salad on its own
crush the garlic and finely slice the chilli and spring onion
 peel and finely slice the red onion, and mix with the garlic, chilli and spring onion
 shred the mangetout, slice the mushrooms and water chestnuts, and mix with the shredded cabbage in a separate bowl to the onion mixture
heat your wok until it’s really hot
 add a splash of oil – it should start to smoke – then the chilli and onion mix
 stir for just 2 seconds before adding the other mix
 flip and toss the vegetables in the wok if you can; if you can’t, don’t worry, just keep the vegetables moving with a wooden spoon, turning them over every few seconds so they all keep feeling the heat of the bottom of the wok
 season with sea salt and black pepper
 after a minute or two, the vegetables should have begun to soften
 add the soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and stir in
 after about 30 seconds the vegetables should smell amazing! tip on to a serving dish, sprinkle over some sesame seeds and tuck in
one of the things i love to do is to stir-fry the corn kernels in a hot wok or frying pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a tablespoon of chopped ginger, a teaspoon of chopped chilli, a handful of chopped fresh parsley and a couple of tablespoons of low-salt soy sauce
 you can vary the flavours with different herbs, but this is a good base to start with
this is a great way to cook aubergines, and probably one that not a lot of people would think of doing
 to me, steamed aubergine sounds horrible but, believe me, this recipe is fantastic
 aubergines are usually fried or roasted, which makes them soak up loads of oil, but steaming means they go really soft and tender so that they're lighter to eat – which means you can eat a lot more! all round the world there are so many different varieties of aubergines – long, round, purple, green – so keep your eyes peeled and try cooking them all
put some water in a pan and bring it to the boil
 slice the aubergines in half lengthways and place them in your steamer with the cut side facing up
 steam them for about 10 minutes – to check whether they're ready, simply squeeze the sides gently and if they're silky soft then they're done
 remove them from the steamer, place them in a colander and leave to cool
now make your dressing by mixing all the ingredients together
 when the aubergines are warm this is the perfect time to flavour them
 cut them up into rough 2 point five  centimetres dice, then dress them and toss
 serve immediately as a salad, tapas dish or as a vegetable next to any simple cooked fish
 just really tasty!preheat your oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6

 tip: if you're a chilli freak like me, try adding a chopped fresh chilli to your tomato sauce
 bring a pot of stock to the boil, then you need to get all the vegetables prepared and put to one side
 the fennel has to be halved, sliced and finely chopped; the asparagus needs to have the woody ends removed, the stalks finely sliced and the tips left whole; the cauliflowers need to be divided into small florets; the courgettes need to be quartered lengthways and finely chopped, and finally the tomatoes need to be blanched, cut in half, seeds removed and finely sliced

season with sea salt and black pepper, then add the spices, chilli, broad beans and lemon zest and whiz until finely chopped 
 stopping once or twice to scrape the mixture off the sides
 sprinkle in the flour and pulse for a few seconds
 don’t add any more flour or the mixture will become too dry
get a large saucepan and pour in the vegetable oil till it’s 5 to 7 centimetres deep
 be careful – keep kids and pets away, and make sure the handle isn’t sticking out so you don’t accidentally catch it and spill the hot oil
heat the oil
 to check whether it’s hot enough for frying, drop in the piece of potato – as soon as it sizzles and floats to the top, you’re in business
 remove the potato and discard it
cover a plate with a sheet of greaseproof paper
 scoop up a small amount of the broad bean mixture and either use your hands or two spoons to shape it into little rounds, then put them on to the plate
when they’re all done, carefully lower one of them into the hot oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper
 when you’re got the hang of it, fry the rest of them – they should all fit into the pan at the same time but, if not, simply do batches

 season carefully to taste and stir around with a spoon to smash up the celeriac
 some people like to keep it in cubes, some like to mash it, but i think it looks and tastes much better if you smash it, which is somewhere in the middle
 you can serve this with just about any meat you can think of
preheat the oven to 170 celsius or 325 fahrenheit or gas 3
score the tops of the tomatoes with a cross
 take an earthenware dish that the tomatoes will fit snugly into, and sprinkle the garlic and basil all over the bottom of it
 stand the tomatoes next to each other in the tray, on top of the garlic and basil, then push the bay leaves well into the scores in the tomatoes and season well
 lay the leeks on a board and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper
 using a rolling pin, press down on top of the leeks to really squeeze the seasoning into them
 this will also loosen their texture
 weave the leeks in and around the tomatoes
 pour over the balsamic vinegar, drizzle over the olive oil, and bake in the preheated oven for an hour

this is the most underrated vegetable in the whole of the united kingdom
 it's available in every single supermarket, we walk past it all the time, and yet we still take no notice of it
 it's an incredible vegetable, it's really good for you and you only need to use 2 or 3 ingredients to bring it to life and blow people's socks off
shave off the celeriac ends and throw them away, then use your knife to peel away the outside skin, cutting away any cracks and crannies as you go
 once you've cut the edge you’ll be able to see the thickness of the skin you need to peel away
 chop the celeriac up into slices, then into rough one centimetre cubes
put a casserole-type pan on a medium-high heat and add a lug of olive oil
 rip in the lemon thyme - the smells from this will be outrageous – then go straight in with the diced celeriac and a generous pinch of salt
 turn the heat down to medium, pop the lid on and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender
 make sure you keep it moving - you want it to fry lightly from the bottom, and kind of steam in its own moisture
 at this stage, you have two choices
 you can either serve it up blonde or you can take the lid off and fry for a further 4 minutes or so, to take the colour much darker
 this is such a flexible recipe, you can make it the day before and reheat when you need, or you can blitz it up with some stock for a delicious soup
 give it a try
jerusalem artichokes are sweet and almost garlicky and mushroomy and gorgeous
 although called artichokes they’re actually tubers – like rough and ready potatoes
 you can scrub and roast them whole like mini jacket potatoes and split them open, drizzled with a little chilli oil
 you can even use them in a salad with smoky bacon
 a jerusalem artichoke’s best friends are sage, thyme, butter, bacon, bay, cream, breadcrumbs, cheese and anything smoked
to serve 4, you will need 600 grams/1lb 6oz of jerusalem artichokes
 peel them, then cut them into chunks
 place them in an oiled frying pan and fry on a medium heat until golden on both sides, then add a few bay leaves, 2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced, a splash of white wine vinegar, some salt and pepper, and place a lid on top
 after about 20 to 25 minutes they will have softened up nicely and you can remove the lid and the bay leaves
 continue cooking for a couple of minutes to crisp the artichoke slices up one last time, then serve straight away
 personally, i think they go well with both meat and fish and are particularly good in a plate of antipasti, or in soups or warm salads
peel the garlic and pick the herb leaves, then finely chop on a large board with the capers, gherkins and anchovies
place in a bowl, add the mustard and vinegar, then slowly stir in the oil until you achieve the right consistency
 balance the flavours with black pepper, a bit of sea salt and maybe a little more vinegar
i'm not quite sure where i got the inspiration for this recipe – i think it was actually when i was making bread one day and i incorporated some really sweet caramelized garlic and almonds into a focaccia
 there's a slightly spanish feel to the main ingredients – think of it as putting a bunch of old friends together and having a good party! my mother's initial reaction was, ‘my god, that's a lot of garlic, you'll stink!’ but don't let the amount put you off, as when garlic is roasted in its skin the pungent flavour is replaced by a jammy sweetness which is divine
roast the garlic cloves in a preheated oven at 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit or gas 4 for around half an hour until soft to the touch
 meanwhile, take a large pot and slowly fry the white onion in 4 tablespoons of olive oil for about 10 minutes until really soft and translucent
 add the cream and the stock, bring back to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes, awaiting your garlic
 remove the garlic from the oven and allow to cool slightly before squeezing out all the sweet, golden paste
 whisk this into the soup
 discard the garlic skins
remove the crusts from your ciabatta, rip up the bread into small pieces and throw into the soup
 add the sherry vinegar, then allow the soup to simmer for 5 more minutes
 whiz it until smooth in your food processor with your toasted almonds
 season nicely to taste and serve in big bowls sprinkled with some orange segments, torn up coriander and mint, and drizzled with a good lug of extra virgin olive oil
try this: you can eat this cold in the summer – it's obviously going to be thick, which i think is a nice thing, but you can thin it with a little milk or stock if you want to
and this: you may want to big up the sherry vinegar to give it that twang you get with a spanish gazpacho soup
or this: there's a similar recipe from spain where sliced white grapes are added to the soup – this contrasts really well with the garlic, so give it a go
 a handful will do
 nice when eaten both hot and cold
preheat your oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 blanch the cauliflower in salted boiling water for a couple of minutes then drain in a colander, allowing it to steam dry 
 you don't want any water left in your cauliflower or it won't roast properly
 toss it in a good lug of olive oil and the butter
 in a pestle and mortar, bash your spices and chillies with a pinch of salt, then mix them with your almonds and put in a hot, dry ovenproof pan to slowly toast them
 after a couple of minutes, add the cauliflower
 when it gets a nice bit of colour on it, add the lemon zest and juice and mix around well
 fry for about a minute longer then pop the pan into the preheated oven for about 15 minutes to crisp up
preheat your oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 i like to serve 4 or 5 baby leeks per person, depending on their size
 lightly trim both ends and peel back the first or second layer of leaves and discard
 drop the leeks in a pan of boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes to soften - this is called blanching
 drain them well 
 if there's too much water in them they won't roast properly
  and toss in a bowl with a good lug of olive oil, a splash of red wine vinegar, the chopped thyme leaves and the garlic
 arrange the leeks in one layer in a baking tray or earthenware dish and roast in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes until golden and almost caramelized
 keep your eye on them - i've seen many chefs burn baby leeks when cooking them this way and it drives me mad!preheat your oven to 190 celsius or 375 fahrenheit or gas 5
 bring two large pans of salted water to the boil
 scrub the beets, then place in one of the pans - keep them separate to stop the rest of your veg turning red! parboil for 20 to 25 minutes
meanwhile, peel the carrots and parsnips, then chop any bigger ones in half along with the turnips
 trim and quarter the fennel
 place the prepped veg together in the second pan and parboil for 10 minutes
 drain all the veg and leave to steam dry, then separate them out so you can hit them with those different flavours
 toss the beets with the balsamic vinegar and whole herb sprigs
 toss the carrots with the clementine juice and throw in the squeezed halves, then pick over the rosemary leaves
 toss the parsnips with the vinegar and tear over the sage leaves
 reserve the honey for later
toss the turnips with the vinegar and bay
 toss the fennel with the lemon juice, then pick over the thyme leaves
 lay them out on a large tray, keeping each veg type together
 if you're making this ahead, you can get up to this stage the day before, then cover them with tin foil and keep them with your spuds till your turkey is resting
 nothing will discolour because of the oil and acid
roast for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until golden, crispy and beautiful
 about 5 minutes before the veg are ready, drizzle the honey over the parsnips
 once ready, give the tray a jiggle, then pile the veg on a platter
preheat the oven to 220 celsius or 425 fahrenheit or gas 7
 peel and chop the potatoes into large chunks, roughly the size of a golf ball
parboil the potatoes in a pan of boiling, salted water for 10 minutes, then drain in a colander, shaking it to chuff up the edges
meanwhile, peel long strips of peel from the oranges using a speed-peeler, and pick the sage leaves
place the goose fat or oil into a large roasting tray 
 you may need to use 2 trays
  on the hob over a low heat, add the unpeeled garlic, orange peel and sage leaves, then fry for 30 seconds
 add the spuds and toss together until well coated
place the tray in the oven and cook for 45 minutes, or until golden and crisp
if you’re going to use cooked carrots in a salad you’ve got to make it with some attitude! this fantastic moroccan-style salad combines roast carrots with avocados – and because they have the same texture in your mouth, i thought i’d add the chargrilled flavour and crunch of toasted ciabatta to round things off
 with spices, seeds, yoghurt and a delicious citrus dressing, you’ve got a winner
 preheat the oven to 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit or gas 4
 parboil your carrots in boiling, salted water for 10 minutes, until they are very nearly cooked, then drain and put them into a roasting tray
 you should flavour them while they’re steaming hot, so while the carrots are cooking get a pestle and mortar and smash up the cumin seeds, chillies, salt and pepper
 add the garlic and thyme leaves and smash up again until you have a kind of paste
 the idea here is to build up the flavours
 add enough extra virgin olive oil to generously cover the paste, and a good swig of vinegar
 this will be like a marinade, a rub and a dressing all in one! stir together, then pour over the carrots in the tray, coating them well
 add the orange and lemon halves, cut-side down
 these will roast along with the carrots, and their juice can be used as the basis of the dressing
 place in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden
  while the carrots are roasting, halve and peel your avocados, discarding the stones, then cut them into wedges lengthways and place in a big bowl
 remove the carrots from the oven and add them to the avocados
 carefully, using some tongs, squeeze the roasted orange and lemon juice into a bowl and add the same amount of extra virgin olive oil and a little swig of red wine vinegar
 season, and pour this dressing over the carrots and avocados
 mix together, have a taste and correct the seasoning
 call your gang round the table while you toast or griddle your ciabatta slices
 tear the toasted bread into little pieces and add to the dressed carrot and avocado
 mix together, toss in the salad leaves and cress and transfer to a big platter or divide between individual plates
 spoon over a nice dollop of yoghurt, sprinkle over your toasted seeds and drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil
once you’ve peeled the celeriac, chuck away the skin and then carry on peeling around it, giving you long ribbons
 if they break every now and again it doesn’t matter
 continue until you reach the fluffy tasteless inner core, which you should throw away
 remove and discard the chunky stalks from the parsley, then finely slice the thinner stalks and roughly chop the leaves
put your celeriac and parsley into a large bowl and mix together with all the other ingredients
 season to taste, adding a little more vinegar if need be, then serve straight away
try this: put some of this salad on a plate, then cover it completely with some smoked salmon and plenty of ground black pepper
or this: roast a nice chicken
 allow it to cool and serve with this salad
the other day i had a nice little roast in the oven – comfort food for a great sunday afternoon
 i had a bunch of raw beetroot to use up, so i thought it would be good to have something nice and zingy to munch on while i was waiting for the chicken to cook – like some tapas or antipasti to get my tastebuds going
 you can get some great beetroots these days – fantastic colours
i took the leaves off the beetroots and threw them away, as i didn't need them for this salad 
 although it's worth remembering that they're edible and that they taste nicer than swiss chard or spinach!
 i washed the beetroots and then, using a speed peeler, i peeled them all down into really thin slices and flavoured them with salt, pepper, chopped flat-leaf parsley and a little grated fresh horseradish to give a nice bit of heat
 then i left them for 5 to 10 minutes so that the acid from the horseradish would soften the beetroot
 the horseradish is optional, but it gives a good twang
this salad is lovely on a bit of toast, with maybe a splash of vodka or a little block of crumbled feta cheese
 really nice to pick at before you have dinner
radicchio, like other bitter leaves such as belgian endive, dandelions, cicoria and treviso, becomes extra special when its bitterness is balanced with other tastes – like the sweetness of balsamic vinegar, the saltiness of parmesan, or the crunchy pepperiness of rocket
 sometimes in life you have one particular thing which, on its own, is nothing, yet mix it up in the right combination and somehow it becomes genius – it’s like this with recipes, and especially this one
get yourself a large bowl and, for each person, toss together a handful of rocket with a small handful of grated parmesan cheese and a quarter of a radicchio, finely sliced
 dress this with a lug of balsamic vinegar, three times as much extra virgin olive oil, and a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
 mix carefully, grate over a little extra parmesan, and eat straight away
 you can vary it by adding things like toasted pine nuts, roasted red onions or crispy bacon
to make the guacamole i use 2 or 3 ripe avocados, 2 or 3 ripe deseeded tomatoes and a couple of deseeded red chillies, and i throw all this into a food processor with a handful of peeled and chopped spring onions and a good handful of fresh coriander
 once this has been chopped up nice and fine, i add a couple more chopped tomatoes, a good pinch of salt and half of another avocado, chopped, to give it a nice chunky texture
 transfer everything into a bowl and season carefully with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon or lime juice
 if you decide to buy ready-made guacamole, which is a bit lazy but probably very realistic, you can put it into a bowl and chirp it up a bit with a squeeze of lemon juice, a little extra salt and a bit of chilli to give it a kick
to fill the quesadillas you will need a couple of big handfuls of grated cheddar and/or red leicester cheese, some finely sliced spring onions, a couple of handfuls of chopped fresh coriander, and a red pepper and some red or green chillies all deseeded and finely chopped
 mix all this up in a bowl and then sprinkle half a handful between two layers of tortilla
 you can make up 4, 10 or even 20 quesadillas and keep them in the fridge until you need them if you want
some people like to fry them in oil, but this makes them greasy and is not all that healthy
 you can grill them, but i like to put them in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, so that after about a minute and a half on each side you are left with a really crispy outside and an oozy, stringy filling
 serve the quesadillas cut into quarters, with the guacamole, soured cream and a beer
ps you can also posh them up a bit using grilled chicken or seafood, leftover pork, shellfish, or a selection of grilled vegetables
make the dressing by mixing together the olive oil, lemon juice and crème fraîche or fromage frais
 cook the potatoes in plenty of boiling salted water for around 20 minutes until tender, and drain well
 when the potatoes are cool enough to handle, rub off the skins with a knife and slice into bite-size pieces
 mix with the dressing, then add the radishes and herbs and season well to taste
as a child i always thought that a simple fruit option for dessert was flippin' boring and it never excited me in the slightest
 but i now realize it was because no one did anything remotely exciting with the fruit
 this recipe, however, i would definitely have enjoyed as a kid
 it's one of those combinations that just explodes in your mouth and you can't get enough of it
 once you try it, you'll never forget it
buy yourself a ripe pineapple
 it should smell slightly sweet and you should be able to remove the leaves quite easily
 cut both ends off and peel the skin with a knife, removing any little black bits
 then cut the pineapple into quarters and remove the slightly less tasty core, which i usually discard or suck on while preparing the rest of the dish
 finely slice your quarters, lengthways, as thin as you can
 lay out flat in one or two layers on a large plate
 don't refrigerate this – just put it to one side
take the plate to the table after dinner with a pot of yoghurt that can be passed round, then return with a pestle and mortar with the sugar in it
 your family or guests will probably think you've gone mad, especially if you ignore them while you do this, but pick the mint leaves and add them to the sugar
 bash the hell out of it in the pestle and mortar at the table
 you'll see the sugar change colour and it will smell fantastic
 it normally takes about a minute to do if you've got a good wrist action
 sprinkle the mint sugar over the plate of pineapple – making sure you don't let anyone nick any pineapple before you sprinkle the sugar over
 what a fantastic thing
 if you have any leftovers, you could always make a piña colada with them
in an appropriately sized pot, slowly fry the onion in the olive oil for about 5 minutes until translucent and soft but not coloured at all
 get your bunch of thyme, tie it up with a little string and add to the pot with the celeriac, potatoes and stock
 bring to the boil and simmer for 40 minutes until the vegetables are tender
 add the cream, bring back to the boil, then remove the thyme and purée the mixture in a liquidizer or food processor
 season carefully to taste, adding the truffle oil tablespoon by tablespoon – the oil can vary in strength depending on the brand
 divide between your serving bowls
 feel free to improvise by adding croûtons, a little extra cream or, if you're really lucky, some real black or white truffles shaved over the top
try this: if you want to give an edge to this comforting soup, try dressing some chopped parsley and celery leaves with a little olive oil and lemon juice
 sprinkle over the soup at the last minute before serving
recipe for pizza dough and tomato sauce can be found here
smear the tomato sauce evenly over the pizza base
 scatter them over the pizza base and put small torn-up pieces of mozzarella into the gaps
 cook until crisp and golden
this might sound odd but it's totally delicious for breakfast or dessert
 especially with a ball of vanilla ice-cream – great!recipe for pizza dough can be found here
in a bowl mix together the grapes, pine nuts, rosemary, sugar and white wine and allow to sit for a few minutes
 then scatter, with the juice, all over the pizza base
 crumble over little pieces of ricotta and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil
 cook until crisp and golden
peel the garlic, then pound in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of sea salt
pick, roughly chop and add the basil leaves, then bash to a paste 
 or pulse in a food processor
add the pine nuts 
 very lightly toast first, if you like
  to the mixture and pound again, then stir in half the parmesan
drizzle in some oil – you need just enough to bind the sauce and get it to an oozy consistency
add most of the remaining cheese, then season to perfection with salt and black pepper
 have a taste, and keep adding a bit more cheese or oil until you are happy with the taste and consistency
 add a squeeze of lemon juice at the end to give it a little twang, if you like, but it’s not essential
preheat the oven to 190 celsius or 375 fahrenheit or gas 5
 peel the potatoes, cutting any larger ones so they’re all an even-size – twice the size of a squash ball is about right
 wash the potatoes in cold water to get rid of any extra starch then tip into a large pot, cover with cold salted water and parboil for 7 minutes, then drain in a colander and leave to steam dry for 3 minutes
 give the colander a bit of a shake to help chuff up the potatoes – this will help to make them super-crisp later on
 at this point, you need to decide which flavour combo to go with
 tip the potatoes into a large tray in one layer, and add the fat – olive oil, butter or goose fat – then season really well with sea salt and black pepper
toss the potatoes in the fat 
 you could get the potatoes up to this stage the day before, simply cover them with clingfilm or tin foil and pop in the fridge or in a cool place until needed
 , then roast for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden and three quarters cooked
 now’s the time for my trick
 gently squash each potato with a potato masher to increase the surface area – the more of your potato that’s in contact with the pan, the crispier it will be
 add 1 good lug of oil to a small bowl and pick and/or tear in the herbs
 if opting for flavour combo 2, peel in a good few strips of clementine zest with a speed-peeler – you won’t eat these but they’ll add amazing flavour
 break up the garlic bulb, adding the unpeeled cloves to the bowl, along with a splash of red wine vinegar, then scrunch and mix it up a bit
 add your chosen flavour combo to the potatoes and give the pan a good shake, then pop back in the hot oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until gnarly, crispy, bubbly and delicious
 transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain off some of the excess fat, then tuck in!the simplest way to cook spinach is in a pan with a little butter, a grating of nutmeg and a tiny squeeze of lemon juice with a lid on to let it steam
 this will taste great, and it goes with just about anything – pasta, fish or meat
 if there is any excess moisture when the spinach is cooked, just tilt the pan so it runs to the other side and pour it away
 let the spinach sit for a minute and then serve
preheat oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 throw the tomatoes into a large roasting tin, drizzle them with olive oil, season with some salt and pepper and pop them in the preheated oven for 20 minutes
 once they’re roasted, squash the tomatoes with a fork to get the juices going and drizzle over some balsamic vinegar
 bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta according to the pack instructions until al dente
 drain the pasta and add the roasted tomato sauce and the olives
 tear over most of the basil leaves and toss everything together
 season and serve with the reserved basil leaves scattered over and some freshly grated pecorino
deseed and slice the peppers and put them in a large frying pan over a medium heat with a little olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper
 place a lid on, and cook slowly for 15 minutes until softened
 don't rush this too much, as cooking the peppers slowly like this really helps to bring out the flavour
 while the peppers are cooking, peel and finely slice the onion, and peel and grate the garlic
 finely chop the parsley leaves and reserve the stalks
add the onion to the pan and cook for a further 20 minutes
 then add the garlic and parsley stalks and toss around, keeping everything moving in the pan
 cook for about 3 minutes most
 have a little taste, and season with a bit more salt and pepper
 add the vinegar – it will sizzle away, so give everything a good toss
 grate the parmesan and add one handful of the parmesan and the mascarpone or crème fraîche, if using, and turn the heat down to minimum while you cook the pasta
meanwhile, put a large pot of salted water on to boil
 add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the packet instructions
 when cooked, drain in a colander, reserving some of the cooking water
 put the peppers, pasta and parsley leaves into a large warmed bowl
 give them a good toss together, then add a little of the pasta cooking water and a few good lugs of extra virgin olive oil to coat the pasta nicely
 serve straight away sprinkled with the rest of the parmesan
get a high-sided pan or wok on a medium-high heat to get nice and hot, and pour your stock into a small pan on a low heat to get warm
 to make your fragrant soup base, add the lime leaves, chillies, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and a pinch of salt to a food processor
 chop the top few leaves off your bunch of coriander and pop to one side, then add the rest to the processor and blitz for 30 seconds or so until fairly fine
 with the processor still running, add a few good lugs of olive oil, the five-spice and ground cumin
 tip this mixture straight into your hot pan, you can add a splash of stock to loosen it if you want, and fry and stir for a couple of minutes so it starts smelling fantastic
 add your sliced onion, then cook gently for 8 to 10 minutes
add the squash to the pan and stir well, then pour in the stock
 bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes until the squash is lovely and soft
 at this point, add the rice and give it a really good stir
 if it looks a bit dry, you can add a splash of water here
 continue to simmer for about 8 minutes until the rice is almost cooked, then add the coconut milk and bring back to the boil
 simmer for a couple of minutes until hot through and thickened a little
 i like to squash up some of the squash at this point too
 take the pan off the heat, give it a good stir, then taste and season carefully with salt and pepper
 to give it a bit of twang add the lime juice – the amount you need will depend on how juicy your limes are, so keep tasting it as you go
 scatter with more sliced fresh chilli and your reserved coriander leaves before serving
  you can then use this as a receptacle for your hot soup, and as long as it’s an inch or so thick, it should keep warm for a good hour or so
 have it sitting out at the party with a load of little cups and bowls lined up next to it and a bunch of lime wedges, and let everyone help themselves!add your fresh or dried and soaked beans to a pan of water with the bay leaf – this will help to flavour the beans and soften their skins
 squash the tomato, peel the potato and add both to the pan
 cook until the beans are tender – taste one to check they’re nice and soft
 dried beans can take up to an hour, but check fresh ones after 25 minutes
 drain 
 reserving about half a glass of the cooking water
 , and discard the bay leaf, tomato and potato
peel and finely chop your onions, carrots and garlic
 trim and finely chop the celery
 heat a saucepan with a splash of olive oil and add the vegetables to the pan with the ground fennel seeds and chilli
 sweat very slowly on a low heat with the lid just ajar for around 15 to 20 minutes until soft, but not brown
 add the tomatoes and bring to a gentle simmer for a few minutes
add the cooked and drained beans with a little of the water they were cooked in, and bring back to the boil
 finely slice the cavolo nero 
 stalks and all
  and add to the pan – it will look like loads, but don’t worry as it will cook down
tear the bread into chunks, then moisten with a little of the cooking water and stir it in too
 the soup should be thick but not dry, so add a little more cooking water if you need to loosen it
 continue cooking for about 30 minutes – you want to achieve a silky, thick soup
season the ribollita with sea salt and black pepper, and stir in 4 good lugs of good-quality tuscan extra virgin olive oil before serving to give it a glossy velvety texture
 delicious served on a cold winter’s day with lots and lots of chianti!first of all pod your beans
 when i’m doing mine i round up friends and family to get the job done quicker
 i also put the larger ones in one bowl and the smaller ones in another – they’ll need different cooking times
 blanch the beans in unsalted boiling water for a couple of minutes, giving the large ones a bit longer 
 don’t add salt, as this will toughen the skins
 drain them and lay them flat on a tray to cool down slightly
 this salad always works best when the beans are eaten slightly warm
 if you’re making it in advance, though, you could always give them a quick flash in the microwave just before serving
 remove the skins from the larger beans if necessary
 place in a bowl and dress with the juice of 1 lemon and three times as much extra virgin olive oil
 season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
 add a little more lemon juice if needed – feel free to adjust to your taste
 at this stage i like to finely slice half the mint and add it to the beans while they sit and marinate for a little while
in a shallow pan, on a medium heat, fry the chopped onion, cumin seeds and chilli in a little olive oil
 stir and cook until softened
 as the onions start to colour, add your breadcrumbs and mix these really well into the onions
 continue to cook until the crumbs are crispy and golden, then season them to taste and put to one side
 to serve, divide the yoghurt or soured cream between four plates or bowls
 give the broad beans a final toss, add the rest of the mint leaves, and divide between the plates on top of the yoghurt
 finally, sprinkle over the warm spiced crunchy bits
sometimes i like to zest a bit of lemon over the top to give a little edge
 fantastic served with grilled chicken or as a tapas or antipasti style thing
 also great with flatbreads like pitta
first of all, finely slice your carrots into matchstick-sized batons
 finely slice your radishes – you can leave a little of the tops on if you like
 quarter your apples, remove the cores and finely slice
 add all these to a bowl with the rest of the ingredients, apart from the sesame seeds
 toss together, carefully checking the seasoning, and serve with the sesame seeds sprinkled over the top
 eat straight away
try this: turn it into a warm salad by adding some pan-seared chicken, prawns or scallops which have been dusted with a little paprika
and this: make it more of a snack by frying some halloumi cheese until golden with some chopped fresh chilli and crumbling this over the top
or this: grill some pitta bread and serve stuffed with the crunch salad
 crumble in some feta cheese too
 lovely
add the peas to a cold pan
 put the small bunch of mint on top of the peas, then boil the kettle
 pour just enough boiling water over the peas and mint to cover them, then put the pan on a high heat with a lid on
 bring back to the boil and cook until the peas are just perfect and tender – this should only be a couple of minutes
 immediately drain in a colander, then place the peas and mint into a salad-type bowl
 sprinkle with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice or a swig of good-quality red or white wine vinegar
 cover the peas and mint with the olive oil 
 it’s important to use the best you can get, as the better the quality, the better the dish
  and mix around
 put to one side for half an hour, after which the flavours will really have started to develop
there are so many things you can serve these peas with: from grilled fish to bruschetta or crostini, roasted or grilled lamb cutlets or pork, or served next to a hearty roast chicken
 it’s always exciting to see lovely green peas under golden green oil
this simple little salad can be quite extraordinary, but you’ve got to season it with that mexican spirit by being brave with the lime juice, salt and chilli, until it’s singing in your mouth
 it does a great job of waking up the other things it’s served with – a few spoonfuls of this next to a grilled chicken breast or pork chop would be an absolute celebration
veg-wise, the onion, coriander and white cabbage are non-negotiable, as they form the base of this salad, but feel free to have a play with the other ingredients and use things like fennel or asparagus
 basically whatever’s in season and available should be a nice addition
the easiest and quickest way to make this is to use a food processor with a slicer attachment or a mandolin
 if you don’t have either of those, use a speed peeler, or simply grate everything finely
shred your white and red cabbage into two separate piles
 put just the white cabbage into a large bowl with the radishes, carrots and most of the coriander
 mix everything together really well, then kick up the flavours by adding almost all the chopped chilli, the sliced red onion and a good few lugs of extra virgin olive oil
 add most of the lime juice and a good pinch of sea salt, then toss together and have a taste
 just keep adjusting everything, adding more fragrance with the coriander, heat with the last of the chilli and acid with another squeeze of lime juice, until it’s just right for you
when you’re happy, fold in the red cabbage right before serving so it doesn’t stain everything, and tuck in
use a pestle and mortar to crush the coriander seeds, but don’t let them get too fine
 peel off long thick strips of lemon zest and place in a bowl with the olives
 squeeze the lemon then top with 3 times as much extra virgin olive oil
 add salt, pepper and the crushed coriander seeds
 pour the dressing over the olives and leave to marinate
 the longer you leave them, the better they’ll taste
preheat your oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
cook the macaroni in a pan of salted boiling water 2 minutes short of the timing on the packet instructions, then drain in a colander and reserve a little of the cooking water
heat the oil in a large heavy-based frying pan, add the marjoram or oregano and fry for a minute until it starts to crisp up, then turn off the heat
add your cooked pasta to the marjoram or oregano butter, along with a couple of spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water and the parmesan, fontina or taleggio and mascarpone
 return to a medium heat and toss and stir around until most of the cheese has melted and you have a lovely gooey sauce – you may need to add a little more of the reserved cooking water
season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, then tip it all into an earthenware dish
 grate over a quarter of the nutmeg, tear over the mozzarella and sprinkle over the extra parmesan
bake the macaroni cheese in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, finishing up with a quick whack under the grill, until golden brown and crispy on top
i've always wanted to know how indian and thai chefs make tasty rice
 this is a great way to liven up plain rice but feel free to take it a step further by adding turmeric, like my indian friend das
 or hot it up with a little chilli powder
 you can also fry some broken nuts, scramble in some eggs, try any ideas or flavours that you think are apt
throw the rice into boiling water, cook for 10 minutes and drain
 heat the oil in a small frying pan, over a medium heat
 add the mustard seeds and as they begin to pop add the urad dhal, curry leaves and strips of lemon rind 
 remove these with a vegetable peeler
 leave to cook for 1 minute until the urad dhal and lemon peel are lightly coloured
 add the drained steaming rice to a bowl and pour over the cooked spices, lemon juice and chopped coriander
 season to taste
 serve with a good curry
cook the linguine in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain and return to the pan
meanwhile, finely grate the zest from 1 lemon into a bowl, then squeeze in the juice from all three
 drizzle in 6 tablespoons of oil, and finely grate in the parmesan, then beat together – it’ll go thick and creamy
 season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, and extra lemon juice, if needed
 pick and finely chop the basil leaves
add the lemony sauce to the linguine and shake the pan to coat each strand of pasta 
 the parmesan will melt when mixed with the pasta
 finish by stirring through the chopped basil and rocket
combine the bread flour, 00 flour, water, yeast and 15 grams salt in a mixing bowl and knead gently until smooth
 this should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes
 cover the mixing bowl with a tea towel and leave to rest, in a warm place, for 45 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size
 this allows the bread to become lighter and softer in texture
 while the dough is rising, prepare a baking tray by lightly oiling the base and sides using vegetable oil
 now’s a good time to make sure your wood fire oven is pre-lit and ready for your bread
transfer the dough to the baking tray
 spread out evenly using the palm of your hands and gently expel the gas from the dough 
 you’ll notice that the dough is airy
 drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over the surface of the dough using your fingertips; 'dimple' the dough ensuring that you don’t press all the way through to the base
 cover with the tea towel and leave to rest in a warm place for a further 20 to 40 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size
place the baking tray in the wood-fired oven for 15 minutes or until lightly golden; this will vary depending on temperature so it's best to keep a close eye on the bread for your first attempt
 just prior to the bread coming out of the wood-fired oven, mix together 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of water
 whisk lightly until it becomes an opaque emulsion
 once removed, brush the bread with the emulsion 
 i use a pastry brush
 , which makes the bread surface moist
 to finish, stud the bread with fresh sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt
 serve warm with a small bowl of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar
 this dish can be eaten either cold as an antipasto or warm as a vegetable contorno
 the great thing about it is that you can use any combination of greens, such as baby cabbage leaves, swiss chard and even salad leaves like cos, gem or romaine
 you can easily buy a big bag of spinach, rocket and watercress and use some yellow celery leaves and other herbs like basil, parsley, sorrel and fennel tops to give you a good mixture
 most italians have a vegetable garden, and no matter how big or small it is they always have greens and veggies to hand
 this recipe sees the more robust leaves blanched first, then wilted down in a pan with the salad leaves, herbs and garlic until soft and tender
blanch the cabbage leaves and chard to perfection in a pot of salted boiling water for a couple of minutes, then drain in a colander and leave to cool down a little
 put a couple of good lugs of olive oil into a large frying pan or casserole type dish and add the sliced garlic
 as soon as it starts to take on the smallest amount of colour, throw in your salad leaves then the cabbage and swiss chard
 cook on a medium heat for about 4 to 5 minutes, moving the greens around the pan with a spoon or a pair of tongs, then add your herbs and cook for a further minute
 remove from the heat and season carefully to taste with salt and pepper, some good-quality extra virgin olive oil and enough lemon juice to give it a little kick
preheat the oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 soak the farro or bulgar wheat in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain
meanwhile, slice the courgettes crossways into chunky crescents and put into a large roasting tray
 add the remaining vegetables and garlic cloves and toss together with a good splash of olive oil
 season well
spread the vegetables out in one layer if you can, as they’ll roast better this way – use 2 trays if you have to
 roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, removing the trays from the oven and carefully shaking them every now and then, until the vegetables are cooked through and crisp around the edges
 sprinkle the vinegar over the vegetables as soon as they come out of the oven and set aside to cool
 when cool, tip on to a large chopping board, add the fresh herbs and chop it all finely
place the farro or bulgar wheat in a large saucepan, cover with fresh cold water and bring to the boil
 simmer for 20 minutes or until tender, then drain well
 dress the farro or bulgar wheat with a good splash of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice, season with salt and pepper and toss with the chopped vegetables
 scatter the reserved fennel tops over the mix and serve
cut the aubergine into large chunks
 peel and finely chop the onion, then peel and finely slice the garlic
 pick and chop the parsley leaves and finely chop the stalks
rinse, soak and drain the capers and remove the olive stones
 roughly chop the tomatoes
 toast the almonds, if using, under a hot grill or in an oven until light brown
get yourself a large pan, pour in a couple of lugs of olive oil, and place on the heat
 add your aubergine chunks and oregano, season with a little sea salt and toss around so the aubergine is evenly coated by the oil
 cook on a high heat for around 4 or 5 minutes, giving the pan a shake every now and then
 depending on the size of your pan you may need to cook the aubergine in batches
  when the aubergines are nice and golden on each side, add the onion, garlic and parsley stalks, and continue cooking for another couple of minutes
 feel free to add a little more oil to the pan if you feel it's getting too dry
 throw in the drained capers and the olives, and drizzle over the herb vinegar
 when all the vinegar has evaporated, add the tomatoes and simmer for around 15 minutes or until tender
 taste before serving and season if you need to with salt, black pepper and a little more vinegar
 drizzle with some good olive oil and serve sprinkled with the chopped parsley leaves and the almonds if you like
hush puppies are little savoury doughnuts and i think they’re quite cool
 i was told their name comes from the time of the great depression, when loads of people were going hungry
 when they did get a bit of food, their hungry dogs would hang around whining, so they’d throw these little buns to them to keep them quiet
 that might be an old wives’ tale, but if it is, i don’t care because i like the story
 ok, they’re not the healthiest things on the planet, but every now and then 
 they’re not going to hurt you
put the cornmeal and flour into a bowl, add your beer, and leave to sit for a few minutes
 add the corn, sliced spring onions, grated cheese and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and use a fork or a spoon to mix it up really well
 once your batter is ready, pour your vegetable oil into a large sturdy pan and put it on a high heat
 please make sure you don’t move the pan about and that no one is running around the kitchen while you’re doing this, as hot oil can burn quite badly
you want the oil to reach about 180ºc, so if you don’t have a thermometer get a small piece of potato and drop it into the pan
 when it turns crisp and golden and rises to the top, the oil is ready to go
 get a tablespoonful of mix and carefully drop it into the hot oil
 in georgia they roll their batter into round balls, but i say just let it drop off the spoon: a bit scruffy and rustic feels right to me
 you’ll need to cook them in batches
keep your eye on them and let them fry for about 3 to 4 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper
 sprinkle over a tiny bit of sea salt and a hit of paprika to finish them off, and serve right away, either on their own or as they do at roadside restaurants, as part of a meal with the amazing pork and slaw
 naughty but nice!drain your soaked beans, then give them a good wash
 place them in a deep pot and cover them with cold water
 throw in your garlic, herb sprigs, bay leaves, celery stick, potato and tomatoes
place the beans on the heat and slowly bring to the boil
 cover with a lid and simmer very gently for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on whether you’re using fresh or dried, until soft and cooked nicely
 skim if necessary, topping up with boiling water from the kettle if you need to
when the beans are cooked, drain them in a colander, reserving enough of the cooking water to cover them halfway up when put back in the pot
 remove the garlic, herbs, celery, potato and tomatoes from the beans
 squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and pinch the skin off the tomatoes
 put the garlic, tomatoes and potato on to a plate, mash them with a fork and stir back into the beans
 season well with salt and pepper, and pour in three generous lugs of extra virgin olive oil and a few splashes of vinegar
 stir in the parsley and serve on some toasted sourdough bread
mix everything together in a bowl and season to taste
place all the vegetables in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan with a big splash of olive oil and the ginger, garlic, chilli, basil stalks, coriander seeds and cloves
 season with a teaspoon of black pepper and a good pinch of sea salt
 cook gently over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened, stirring every so often
 add all the tomatoes and 350 millimetres of cold water
 bring to the boil and simmer gently until the sauce reduces by half
 add the basil leaves, then whiz the sauce in a food processor or with a hand blender and push it through a sieve twice, to make it smooth and shiny
 put the sauce into a clean pan and add the vinegar and the sugar
place the sauce on the heat and simmer until it reduces and thickens to the consistency of tomato ketchup
 at this point, correct the seasoning to taste
 spoon the ketchup through a sterilized funnel into sterilized bottles, then seal tightly and place in a cool dark place or the fridge until needed – it should keep for six months
 great served with steak and chips
preheat your oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 chop the marjoram leaves, or pound them in a pestle and mortar
 put them in a bowl with a tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of pepper
 rub this mixture all over the goats' cheese and bake in the preheated oven for around 10 to 15 minutes until nice and golden
 toss the rocket, fennel, olives and lemon basil together in a bowl
 dress your salad with around 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and just over half your lemon juice, and season
 divide over four plates and sprinkle over the crumbled goat’s cheese and sliced chilli 
 fantastic!a mushroom risotto can be taken in many different ways, depending on what kind of mushrooms you have and whether they are introduced at the very beginning of cooking or just added at the end, as i’m going to do here
 the inspiration for this recipe came when i was in japan and saw mushrooms being cooked completely dry on a barbecue or griddle pan
 this way of cooking brings out a really fresh and nutty flavour in them; perfect for being dressed lightly with olive oil, salt and lemon juice or stirred into a risotto at the last minute before serving
heat your stock in a saucepan and keep it on a low simmer
 place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl and pour in just enough hot stock to cover
 leave for a couple of minutes until they’ve softened
 fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid
in a large pan, heat a lug of olive oil and add the onion and celery
 slowly fry without colouring them for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice
 give it a stir
 stir in the vermouth or wine – it’ll smell fantastic! keep stirring until the liquid has cooked into the rice
 now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan and add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock
 turn the heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next
carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite
 this will take about 30 minutes
 meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until soft
 if your pan isn’t big enough, do this in batches
 put them into a bowl and add the chopped herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice
 using your hands, get stuck in and toss everything together – this is going to be incredible!take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully
 stir in the butter and the parmesan
 you want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you think it needs it
 put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes
take your risotto and add a little more seasoning or parmesan if you like
 serve a good dollop of risotto topped with some grilled dressed mushrooms, a sprinkling of freshly grated parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil
follow my basic bread recipe through steps 1 to 4
 after the dough has doubled in size, you need to knock the air out of it by bashing it around for a minute
 now it’s ready to be transformed into pizzas or flatbreads
tear off chunks of the dough and roll out your bread, shaping into slightly irregular oval shape rounds, about 0 point five  centimetres thick
oil the grill on the barbie, then lay the flatbreads on top of the grill and cook them for about 3 minutes
 turn them over and cook for another 3 minutes until they are golden brown, crispy and slightly charred – this’ll give them a real barbecued flavour
take the flatbreads off the barbie
 mix a couple of lugs of olive oil with the rosemary leaves and brush 
 or drizzle
  over the hot breads
 sprinkle with salt and serve straight away while still warm
wash whichever kind of asparagus you’re using, with their woody ends snipped off
heat a large griddle pan and dry-griddle the asparagus spears on both sides until nicely marked
 as soon as they're ready, put them on to four plates and dress with a good squeeze of lemon juice and three times as much olive oil
season with sea salt and black pepper to taste, then take a block of parmesan to the table and either grate or shave some over the asparagus with a speed peeler
i think it’s quite nice to have different shapes and sizes in a salad, so cut your medium tomato into wedges, halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the beef tomato into large rounds
 put all the tomatoes into a large salad bowl
 slice the onion very finely so it’s wafer thin and add to the tomatoes
 scratch a fork down the sides of the cucumber so it leaves deep grooves in the skin, then cut it into thick slices
 deseed your pepper, slice it into rings and add them to the salad along with the cucumber
roughly chop the dill and most of the mint leaves, reserving the smaller ones for garnish
 add the chopped herbs to the bowl of salad, then squeeze your handful of olives over so they season the vegetables, then drop them in
add a pinch of sea salt, the vinegar and the extra virgin olive oil
 quickly toss everything together with your hands
 the minute all those flavours start working with the veg is when the magic starts to happen
 have a taste, and adjust the flavours if need be
to serve, pop the block of feta right on the top of the salad
 sprinkle the oregano over the top along with the reserved mint leaves, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and take it straight to the table
 it’s confident and scruffy with a bit of attitude
 delicious
ps i’ve been known to pop leftover greek salad into a liquidizer with a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a few ice cubes, then blitz it up to a smooth consistency so it's basically a greek gazpacho
 it’s not a classic thing to do, but it is very delicious, not to mention a great way of using up leftovers!gordita means ‘little fat girl’ in spanish and is meant as a sort of cute, cuddly term of endearment
 it’s also the name for these sweet little puffy tortillas, which are often made around easter and other special occasions
 look at the gorditas as a tasty spoon for carrying all kinds of big exciting flavours
 mexicans put all sorts of things, from beans, to meat, to salsa, on them
 i’ve gone for quite a delicious and delicate apple salsa here – give it a try
put the cornmeal and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the centre
 mix the baking powder into the hot water and pour this into the well
 using a fork, mix the cornmeal into the liquid, and when it starts to come together use your hands to knead it
 divide the dough into 16 equal squash-ball-sized pieces and dust them lightly with flour
 roll each piece around in your hands, then pat and flatten into a small round roughly the size of the base of a wine glass
 put these on an oiled tray, dust with flour and put aside while you make your salsa
 finely chop your apple, tomatoes and spring onions, and finely slice your chilli
 put them all into a bowl
 pick the leaves from your coriander and put them into a bowl of water until you’re ready to serve
 chop the coriander stalks up nice and finely and add to the bowl with the other salsa ingredients
  put a large pan on a medium heat and add your pumpkin and sunflower seeds
 toss them around for a few minutes and toast them
 add them to your salsa with the juice of your lime, a good lug of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper
 mix well, then have a taste and add a little more seasoning, lime juice or chilli if you think it needs more attitude
 put the pan back on a medium heat and add a couple of good lugs of olive oil
 cook as many gorditas as will comfortably fit into the pan for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until they’re golden and puff up a little
serve the gorditas warm out of the pan with a tablespoon of your beautiful salsa, a little hunk of cheese, a couple of your drained coriander leaves and a few slices of chilli, if you fancy, and with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over
bring a pan of water to a fast boil, add your beans, put a lid on the pan, and cook for at least 4 to 5 minutes
 boiling the beans fast like this helps them to retain all their nutrients
 meanwhile, put the mustard and vinegar into a jam jar or bowl and, while stirring, add the olive oil to make a good hot french dressing
 season carefully with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add the finely chopped shallot, the capers if you're using them and the garlic
remove one of the beans from the pan to check if it's cooked
 if it holds its shape but is also soft to the bite, it's perfect
 drain in a colander
 now, while the beans are steaming hot, this is the perfect moment to dress them – a hot bean will take on more of the wonderful dressing than a cold one
 it is best to serve the beans warm, not cold, and certainly not at fridge temperature because the flavours will be muted and boring
 serve the beans in a bowl, sprinkled with chervil if you like – it's a delicate, crunchy herb that goes well with beans
 serve as a salad in its own right, or as an accompaniment to a main meal
when i took my students to italy to see how olive oil was made, we ate these ‘fried’ pizzas at a great little restaurant called il vescovino in panzano in the chianti region
 the chef fried the thin bases in oil, like poppadoms, then quickly topped them with tomato sauce, mozzarella and a little bit of oregano and popped them straight under a hot grill
 they were the lightest pizzas i've ever eaten – just incredible – and this is how the first ever pizzas were made
first, make your basic pizza dough
 now make your tomato sauce
 heat a saucepan, add a splash of oil and the sliced garlic and cook gently
 when the garlic has turned light golden, add half the basil, the tomatoes and a few pinches of salt and pepper
 cook gently for about 20 minutes, mashing the tomatoes until smooth, then taste, season again and put to one side
preheat your grill to its highest temperature
 divide the dough into 10 pieces and press them flat on to a floured work surface
 heat a frying pan over a high heat, add about 2 centimetres of vegetable oil and fry each pizza for 30 seconds or so on each side
 remove with tongs and place on a baking tray
once all the bases are fried, smear each one with a spoonful of the tomato sauce and tear over some mozzarella and a leaf or two of basil or dried oregano
 drizzle with olive oil and grill until the cheese is bubbling and the dough is light brown and cooked through
preheat your barbecue
 beat the crème fraîche with the seeds from the vanilla pod and put to one side
cut the ends off the pineapple
 sit it on a board and cut off the skin in wide strips from top to bottom, making sure you cut out any woody eyes
 thinly slice the pineapple, and dust the slices with icing sugar
make sure the bars of the barbecue are clean – especially if you’ve been cooking fish or meat beforehand – and drop the slices of pineapple on to it
 grill for about 30 seconds on each side then lift off with the tongs and transfer to a serving plate
serve scattered with mint and a generous dollop of vanilla-flavoured crème fraîche
lay your figs, cut-side up, in a baking tray
 using a fine grater, zest your clementines over the figs then dust the figs with a sprinkling of cinnamon and a teaspoon of sugar
 pop the figs in the oven to bake for 4 hours, checking on them every hour or so
 when they come out of the oven you’ll have semi-dehydrated figs, which will be a bit like wine gums
 a really nice way of using them at christmas is to turn them into a bit of a gift by popping a stack of them in a sterilised jar, covering them completely with honey then sealing the jar with an airtight lid
 they’ll be beautiful as part of a cheese platter, baked in a tart, a sticky toffee pud, or even thrown into a roasting tray with some pork or other meat for a bit of added sweetness
 give them to your mates when you go round to theirs for dinner
 they’ll love getting something unique, especially when you explain all the different things they can do with them
to me, fennel is a really tasty, classy and under-used vegetable
 it works really well with the ricotta in this recipe and has a fantastic sweetness
 please don’t buy the crappy ricotta that a lot of the supermarkets have – make sure it’s light and crumbly and, if you’re out of luck, a fresh goat’s cheese is pretty damn good too
put your fennel seeds into a pestle and mortar and bash up to a powder
 get a wide, hot saucepan, add a couple of splashes of olive oil and fry the garlic until softened, then add the bashed fennel seeds and sliced fennel
 add a pinch of salt and pepper and turn down to a medium-low heat
 place a lid on the pan and cook nice and slowly for around 20 minutes, until the fennel’s soft and sweet
start the risotto bianco as usual and continue through the recipe until the rice is half cooked
 half-way through stage 3, stir in the sautéd fennel, then keep cooking the risotto until the rice is perfectly cooked
bash up the dried chillies in the pestle and mortar until you have a fine powder
 at stage 4, when you add the butter and parmesan, add the crumbled ricotta and lemon zest
 check the seasoning carefully and balance the flavour with as much lemon juice as you feel it needs to work with the fennel
 divide between your plates, sprinkle over your fennel tops and dust with the ground chilli
 grate over some fresh parmesan at the table
for the dressing, pound together or finely chop the garlic and anchovies
 mix in the yoghurt, then the zest and juice of the lemon, and season to taste with freshly ground black pepper
 simple!preheat the oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 tear the bread into rough pieces of about an inch or so and scatter into a roasting tin
 drizzle the bread with a little olive oil then toss with a good pinch of sea salt and bake for 10 minutes or until crunchy
trim the bottoms of the little gems then break up each one, keeping the leaves whole
 give the watercress and lettuce leaves a quick wash, then dry in a salad spinner and lay on a large serving plate
 cut the top off the fennel and hang on to the feathery parts
 trim the bottom of the bulb and discard the scruffy outer leaves
 cut the bulb in half and slice as thinly as possible from the root to the tip, then add to the rest of the leaves
 next, fry the slices of halloumi on both sides in a little olive oil until golden, then drain on kitchen paper
 add the halloumi and croutons to the serving plate
 season, give the whole lot a gentle toss, then drizzle over the yoghurt dressing
 chop the fennel tops and bash the pomegranate to get the seeds out, then scatter the fennel and seeds over the salad
farro is a grain similar to pearl barley, but it’s dried in such a way that instead of being fluffy and spongy it becomes chewy and nutty
 you may have difficulty getting hold of it, but if you can find it you’ll be using it all the time – it has an unusual flavour half-way between rice and couscous 
 this recipe will also work well with both of these
 in italy it was a major food for the ancient romans, who used it to make bread, porridge and soup before they got hold of wheat
 nowadays it’s used in salads, soups, stews, even pastas
 you should be able to buy farro in good italian delis, and supermarkets have started to stock it in the special selection aisles
 here’s a recipe for one of my fave salads – give it a go
preheat the oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 soak the farro or bulgar wheat in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain
 slice the courgettes across into chunky half-moons and put them into a large roasting tray
 add the remaining vegetables and the garlic cloves and toss together with a good splash of olive oil
 season with pepper and a tiny pinch of salt
 try to spread the vegetables out in one layer, as they’ll roast better this way 
 use 2 trays if you have to
 roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, removing the trays and carefully shaking them now and then, until the vegetables are cooked through and crisp around the edges
 sprinkle a little vinegar over the vegetables as soon as they come out of the oven and set aside to cool
 when cool, tip on to a large chopping board, add the fresh herbs and chop finely
place the farro or bulgar wheat in a large saucepan, cover with fresh cold water and bring to the boil
 simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender, and drain well
 dress with olive oil and the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and toss with the roasted herby vegetables
 scatter over the reserved fennel tops and serve
peel and crush the garlic, peel and slice the onions and shallots
 trim, wash and slice the leeks
put the butter, 2 lugs of olive oil, the sage leaves 
 reserving 8 for later
  and the crushed garlic into a thick-bottomed, non-stick pan
 stir everything round and add the onions, shallots and leeks
 season with sea salt and black pepper
place a lid on the pan, leaving it slightly ajar, and cook slowly for 50 minutes, without colouring the vegetables too much
 remove the lid for the last 20 minutes – your onions will become soft and golden
 stir occasionally so that nothing catches on the bottom
 having the patience to cook the onions slowly, slowly, gives you an incredible sweetness and an awesome flavour, so don’t be tempted to speed this bit up
when your onions and leeks are lovely and silky, add the stock
 bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes
 you can skim any fat off the surface if you like, but i prefer to leave it because it adds good flavour
preheat the oven or grill to maximum
toast your bread on both sides
 correct the seasoning of the soup
 when it’s perfect, ladle it into individual heatproof serving bowls and place them on a baking tray
tear toasted bread over each bowl to fit it like a lid
 feel free to push and dunk the bread into the soup a bit
 grate over some of the cheddar and drizzle over a little worcestershire sauce
dress your reserved sage leaves with some olive oil and place one on top of each slice of bread
 put the baking tray into the preheated oven or under the grill to melt the cheese until bubbling and golden
 keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn’t burn! when the cheese is bubbling, very carefully lift out the tray and carry it to the table
 enjoy
whether you are using fresh or frozen peas, for 4 people you need to put 4 good handfuls of peas into a wide frying pan or casserole-type pan which has a lid 
 or you can use tinfoil
 , with half a wineglass of white wine, half a wineglass of water and 2 good knobs of butter
 place the lid on top and bring to the boil, then remove the lid and simmer for a minute or two while you finely slice a handful of mint leaves
 with this reasonably small amount of liquid, the butter and wine should form a fantastically simple sauce
 throw in the mint at the last minute and serve straight away
 don't forget that it only takes a handful of grated parmesan cheese and some cooked tagliatelle to turn these peas into a wonderful pasta dish
 or you can add them to a risotto, or whiz them up with some chicken stock to make a fine pea soup
you'll need a selection of freshly picked lettuces such as round lettuce, oak leaf lettuce, lamb's lettuce, watercress, cos lettuce, little gem lettuce, chicory and radicchio 
 about 4 large handfuls
 you'll also need a jam jar dressing of your choice
to wash your salad leaves: when you get your lettuces home, remove the roots and any not-so-nice outside leaves first, then click or tear off the rest of the leaves and give them a good old wash in cold water
 once they’re clean, give them a spin in a salad spinner or shake them dry in a tea towel
 to store your salad leaves: if you line a salad crisper drawer in your refrigerator with a couple of clean kitchen towels and lay your leaves on top, covering them with another towel, they’ll keep there happily for 4 days
 this way you can simply make up your own mixed salads, dressing the leaves with one of my jam jar dressings
 to dress your salad leaves: pour the dressing from a height and gently toss the leaves, using the tips of your fingers, until every single leaf is coated
wash the lentils, then place them in a pan and cover with cold water
 bring to the boil and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender
 meanwhile, blitz all the vegetables, garlic and ginger in a food processor until finely chopped
heat enough oil to cover the bottom of a large saucepan, put it on a low heat, add the spices and fry gently for a couple of minutes
 then add the onions, carrots, pepper, garlic, ginger, coriander stalks, the chilli and all the spices and fry gently for 5-10 minutes until the onions start to soften
 add the tomatoes, water and lentils and simmer for another 30 minutes before adding the coconut milk
 bring to the boil then remove from the heat and blend until smooth using a hand blender
 season to taste
 set aside to cool then use as required
tipany surplus sauce can be frozen to use at a later date
 this recipe is from school dinners
first make your batter
 smash up the cumin and mustard seeds, chillies and peppercorns in a pestle and mortar until you have a powder
 put the flour into a mixing bowl and stir in the ground spices and the turmeric
pour in most of the beer and whisk gently
 check the consistency – you want it to be the thickness of double cream
 if it’s too thick, whisk in the rest of the beer
 don’t worry too much about having little lumps in the batter, as they’ll just become nice crunchy bits when you start frying
 season with sea salt and put to one side
trim the bottom off the stalk and break the cauliflower into bite-sized florets
 slice up the stalk into 2 centimetres pieces – this way it will all cook at the same rate
 place the cauliflower pieces in a bowl and dust with a little flour
pour the oil into a deep saucepan – you want it to be about 10–12 centimetres deep – and heat it to 180°c
 if you don’t have a thermometer don't worry, just drop a piece of potato into the oil
 when it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, the oil will be at the right temperature so remove the potato from the pan
shake any excess flour off the cauliflower
 one by one, dip the pieces into the beer batter, then carefully place them in the hot oil, moving them away from you as you do so
 make sure you stand back so you don’t get splashed
 it’s best to fry them in batches so you don’t overcrowd the pan 
 but serve them as soon as each batch is ready
each time a batch of cauliflower is nearly ready, add some battered parsley leaves to the pan and fry for 40 seconds 
 you want to serve them scattered over the fritters
 fry the pieces gently, turning them a couple of times with a slotted spoon
 when they’re browned and crisp, lift them out of the oil, allowing any excess to drip back into the pan, and drain on kitchen paper
 dust with sea salt and squeeze over a little lemon juice
make the dressing by squeezing the lemon juice into a clean jam jar, topping up with 10 tablespoons of oil, and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper
 secure the lid on the jar, give it a good shake, and put aside until needed
peel and slice the pears and beets into fine matchsticks – if your knife skills aren’t up to speed yet, use a matchstick peeler, mandolin 
 use the guard!
  or box grater
dress the matchsticks in a little of the lemon oil dressing 
 keep the rest in the fridge for another day
  – taste to check that the flavours are balanced, then adjust the seasoning, if needed
divide the salad between plates or place on a serving platter, then crumble over the creamy feta
pick and roughly chop the mint leaves, then sprinkle over the salad with the sunflower seeds 
 if using
this is a fantastic and really unusual salad that was inspired by a friend of mine called das who runs the most terrific indian restaurants in london, called rasa
 although i have called it ‘keralan’, it isn't really a true salad from there as you'd never find cress in kerala! in rasa, das uses a lot of fresh coconut – which really is one of the most incredible flavours for making dishes like curries, or mixed into rice, breads, desserts and salads
 you can now buy coconuts from most supermarkets, but if you can't find one, feel free to make this salad without it – it will still be pretty good but it won't have that special edge to it
 only make this when the mangoes are silky smooth and not at all stringy
 you should be able to cut through them like butter
first of all you need to crack open the shell of the coconut
 i normally do this by placing it on a tea towel on a hard surface and then giving it a wallop with a rolling-pin or a hammer
 once you've cracked it open you can pull it apart 
 being careful not to spill the milk everywhere!
 , discarding the hard outer shell
 the dark skin on the outside of the coconut's flesh doesn't bother me, especially if i'm grating it
 but if you want to remove it, a speed peeler works quite well
once you've got into your coconut, cut the peppers into quarters, remove the stalks and seeds, then finely slice
 trim your cress directly from its punnet 
 the easiest way to do this is to take the cress out of the punnet, wash the leafy end and stalks under a tap, then slice the stalk end off and discard it
 trim your spring onions and finely slice them
 cut the mango flesh off the stones and finely slice it 
 there is a knack to doing this properly – if you look at the shape of the mango, the flat stone always lies the same way, parallel with the flattest sides, so you should be able to slice the flesh off with not too much wastage
 get your pieces of coconut and grate them finely
 put all these ingredients into a large salad bowl
lime and ginger work together really well in the dressing
 finely grate the ginger and lime zest into a small bowl, then add the lime juice and olive oil
 season to taste, and add more oil as necessary to balance the flavours of your dressing
 limes can be different strengths depending on their juiciness and size
dress the salad just before serving, saving any extra dressing for another day, and eat straight away
 great just as it is, or with some grilled prawns or satay chicken
 also lovely as a snack inside a wrap or flatbread
 so even though the coconut may be a pain to prepare it's well worth it
take 3 large handfuls of cavolo nero, cabbage or swiss chard and strip the leaves off the stalks
 add 3 cloves of peeled garlic to a pan of salted water and bring to the boil, then add the cavolo
 cook until tender, then drain well in a colander and allow to cool
 squeeze out any excess water from the cavolo, mush up the garlic, season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil
 toss around and divide on to each of your hot crostini, drizzled with more olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice
see my crostini recipeget yourself about 20 ripe cherry tomatoes, different colours if possible, and cut them into quarters
 remove the stones from a handful of good-quality black or green olives and chop them up
 toss in a bowl with the tomatoes, 2 or 3 lugs of extra virgin olive oil and a swig of balsamic vinegar, and season carefully with salt and pepper and a little crumbled dried chilli
 some olives are salty, so go easy
  spoon over each of your hot crostini recipe
in a pestle and mortar or a food processor, smash up a small handful of mint leaves with 2 good handfuls of freshly podded peas and broad beans until they look like mushy peas
 add a large handful of freshly grated pecorino or parmesan, then loosen with a couple of good lugs of extra virgin olive oil and balance the flavours with a little lemon juice, salt&lt; and pepper
 smear this over each of your hot crostini recipe
get any mixture of soft herbs like fennel tops, green or purple basil, parsley, mint, chervil, thyme tips or sorrel and roughly chop them
 take 6 cherry tomatoes and halve them, then rub one of the halves into each of your hot crostini
 grate some pecorino or parmesan over the top and season with salt and pepper
 drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over your chopped herbs
see my crostini recipe
tear 3 by 150 grams balls of buffalo mozzarella into quarters, then top each of your hot crostini with one of the quarters
 deseed and finely chop a fresh red chilli and sprinkle this over the mozzarella
 add a little seasoning and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil
 lovely with a little fresh basil torn over
see my crostini recipe
these tasty, crispy tortillas with guacamole are superb for snacking on while you're watching telly
 it's all quick and easy to rustle up
preheat the oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 meanwhile, remove and discard the seeds from the chillies, squeeze the juice from the limes, peel the avocados, remove the stone and chop them and roughly chop the fresh coriander
  to make the guacamole, mash or blend the chillies, lime juice, avocado and coriander until creamy but a bit chunky
 season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, and pour into a serving dish
 brush the tortillas with the oil, season, and then sprinkle with the thyme leaves
 lay them on a baking tray – don't overlap them too much – and bake for 5 minutes until golden brown, then leave them to cool
 break into wedges if you like, and serve the crispy tortillas with the guacamole
put all your ingredients into a jam jar with some sea salt and black pepper
 shake, taste and season again if needed until your dressing is perfect
 you may need to add a little more vinegar or oil to balance it
chop the tips off your asparagus and put these to one side for later
 roughly chop the asparagus stalks
get a large, deep pan on the heat and pour in a good lug of olive oil
 gently fry the onions, celery and leeks for around 10 minutes, or until soft and sweet, without colouring
add the chopped asparagus stalks and stock and simmer for 20 minutes with a lid on
 remove from the heat and blitz with a hand-held blender or in a liquidizer
 season the soup bit by bit 
 this is important
  with salt and pepper until just right
put the soup back on the heat, stir in the asparagus tips, bring back to the boil and simmer for a few more minutes, or until the tips have softened
just before i’m ready to serve the soup, i get a wide casserole-type pan on the heat with 8 to 10 centimetres of boiling water
 using really fresh eggs, i very quickly crack all 10 into the water
 don’t worry about poaching so many at the same time
 they don’t have to look perfect
 a couple of minutes and they’ll be done, as you want them to be a bit runny
toast your ciabatta slices
 using a slotted spoon, remove all the poached eggs to a plate and add a knob of butter to them
 to serve, divide the soup between eight warmed bowls and place a piece of toast into each
 put a poached egg on top, cut into it to make it runny, season and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil
this is quite an unusual salad and terribly simple to make
 it's great because it's a nice little side dish that will go with things like mozzarella, goat's cheese, cured meats, grilled or barbecued white fish like cod or haddock, even things like chicken or pork
 use courgettes when at their best 
 nice and firm and not too big
slice 4 courgettes lengthways as thin as you can 
 use a mandolin if you have one
 grill on a red-hot griddle pan, or on the barbecue, until lightly charred on each side
 scatter the slices over a large plate, making sure you don't sit them on top of each other otherwise they'll steam and go a bit limp, and there's nothing worse than limp courgettes, i can tell you
 while they're still warmish, sprinkle them with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
deseed a red chilli and chop finely
 finely chop half a clove of garlic and sprinkle the chilli and garlic evenly from a height over the courgettes
 add to your own taste, but just remember that when the chilli and garlic mix with the olive oil and lemon juice the heat and flavours are lessened
 tear over a handful of fresh mint and drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon
 i've even been known to throw in some blanched broad beans or raw peas if i can get any
 this salad is always a real treat
p
s
 if you find yourself with leftovers, try baking any fish fillets 
 cod, haddock or bass for example
  on top of the courgettes
 lovely with steamed rice and seasoned yoghurt
 very fresh and good for you
pull the leaves from the celery stalks and set them aside
 chop your celery and onion
 heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat
 add the celery 
 not the leaves
 , onion, and thyme
 stir until the vegetables start to brown
 sprinkle the flour over the veggies and stir for a few more minutes
 pour in the milk, add the potato and bring to a boil, stirring the whole time so the soup doesn’t stick to the pot
 cook until the potatoes are tender, but not mushy – this will take around 10 minutes
 meanwhile, chop the celery leaves, trim the ends off the spring onions and slice them thinly
 when the potatoes are tender, stir in the corn, spring onion and celery leaves
 bring the soup back to the boil, then serve
 this is delicious with a crusty brown roll or a parmesan crisp
 beans are magical little things and massively underrated
 i’m showing them some love by pairing them with exciting mexican flavours
 baked in a tortilla with veg and cheese until golden on the outside, but oozy on the inside, it’s a real texture extravaganza
 beans are an amazing veggie source of protein and are packed with fibre, which will keep you nice and full
 they also count as one of your 5-a-day, so this recipe clocks up up two of your 5-a-day! use any leftover beans and tomatoes to make some homemade baked beans – add a pinch of paprika for a smoky kick
preheat the oven to 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit or  gas 4
 peel and finely slice the onion, then deseed and slice up the pepper
 coarsely grate the cheese
heat a little oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat and gently fry the onion for 10 minutes, or until softened
peel and crush the garlic, then add to the pan along with the chilli powder
add the tomato purée and the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon as you go, then drain and add the kidney beans
cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper
in a separate pan, fry the pepper in a little oil until starting to soften, then set aside
divide the filling mixture in half, then blitz one half with a stick blender to form a bean paste – if you don’t have a stick blender, mash with a potato masher
spread the tortillas with the warm bean paste, then add a serving spoon of the filling and sprinkle with cheese
 roll up the tortillas and place on greased baking tins
bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until golden and warmed through
dress the salad leaves in a little oil and vinegar, then serve alongside your bean wraps
this dish is only as good as the vegetables you buy, so use that as your starting point and you'll be on to an absolute winner! here are some tips on buying and preparing a selection of veg
in most supermarkets these days you can get fresh baby carrots with their green tops
 leave about an inch of the tops on and just give the carrots a scrub
do the same with some lovely radishes
 you can get some marbled pink and white oval ones now, which are crunchy and peppery
 again, leave the tops on as these make good handles when it comes to dipping
use nice crunchy lettuces
 sweeter lettuces like cos and romaine are good for dipping – i try to use the inner part, keeping the outer leaves for another salad
 i leave the stalk on and then cut the lettuce into quarters, and that way they stay in one piece, but you don't have to do this
 the important thing is to get good chunks of vegetables
 i like to contrast the sweet lettuces with slightly more bitter ones like radicchio or endive
if you've got some young asparagus that's just come into season, it's really nice eaten raw
 feel free to use your imagination on the veggie side
 little fingers of celery or celeriac are also good
 however, you often come across people who use raw cauliflower with dips – i personally would prefer colonic irrigation! i think cauliflower and broccoli are just awful eaten raw, so i wouldn't suggest using them here
put the yoghurt in a food processor, pick in the mint leaves and whiz up for half a minute or so
 add the peas and the parmesan, and whiz again – the peas will break down and the yoghurt will become green
 put the dip in a bowl, correcting the seasoning with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice
 when you add the lemon juice and peas to the yoghurt, quite often it splits and turns into a kind of cheese, but this is absolutely fine
 it depends on the type of yoghurt you use and how acidic your lemon is
 just pour away any excess water
 usually, though, it doesn't split and is more like a purée, but both ways are good
serve your veggies on a big board or in a big bowl next to the dip
 and have some salt and pepper to hand in case you need it
 it's a good sociable way to start a meal
boil the peas until perfect, then remove from the heat and drain in a colander, saving a small cup of the cooking water
 put the peas back in the pan with some of the reserved water and add a splash of olive oil
 stir around, then sprinkle in the parmesan cheese and stir again until every single pea is lightly coated in the sweet, delicately melted cheese
 you may need to add a bit more water to loosen the peas – you want them to be oozy 
 almost like a risotto consistency
 a small squeeze of lemon juice always lifts the peas and cuts through the cheese, and a sprinkle of white pepper is nice too
this dish is best made quickly at the very last minute as, like a risotto, the moment those peas begin to cool down, things start getting a little claggy and rubbery and you definitely don’t want that
if you want your chutney to last for a while, make sure you have some small sterilised jars ready to go
place your chillies and peppers over a hot barbecue, in a griddle pan or on a tray under a hot grill, turning them now and then until blackened and blistered all over
carefully lift the hot peppers and chillies into a bowl 
 the smaller chillies won’t take as long as the peppers so remove them first
  and cover tightly with cling film
 as they cool down, they’ll cook gently in their own steam
 by the time they’re cool enough to handle, you’ll be able to peel the skin off easily
 when you’ve got rid of most of the skin, trimmed off the stalks and scooped out the seeds, you’ll be left with a pile of nice tasty peppers and chillies
 finely chop by hand or put in a food processor and whiz up
 then put to one side
heat a saucepan and pour in a splash of olive oil
 add the onions, rosemary, bay leaves and cinnamon and season with a little sea salt and black pepper
 cook very slowly for about 20 minutes, or until the onions become rich, golden and sticky
add the chopped peppers and chillies, the sugar and the vinegar to the onions and keep cooking
 when the liquid reduces and you’re left with a lovely thick sticky chutney, season well to taste
remove the cinnamon stick and the bay leaves
 either spoon into the sterilised jars and put them in a cool dark place, or keep in the fridge and use right away
 in sterilised jars, the chutney should keep for a couple of months
heat a large frying pan over a medium heat and add a good few lugs of olive oil
 when the oil’s hot, add the garlic and chilli and fry until lightly coloured
 drop in most of the basil – stand back as it will crackle and spit in the oil – and then, after a few seconds, add the tomatoes
 bring to the boil and simmer for about 5 minutes
 you’ll end up with a chunky sauce – if you like it smoother, pass the sauce through a coarse sieve
 taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper
 keep warm
 bring a large pan of salted water to the boil
 on a lightly floured work surface, cut the lasagne sheets into strips with a knife or a pastry wheel
 when the water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta and cook for a few minutes until just al dente
 drain the pasta strips in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water
 stir the pasta into the warm sauce
 if it’s a bit thick, add a few spoonfuls of the cooking water to loosen it up
 sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan cheese and the reserved basil leaves and serve immediately
mix the beaten egg with the milk and a dash of limoncello in a shallow dish
 dip the bread slices into the mixture and shake off the excess
 sprinkle the slices with the caster sugar, then cook on the barbecue for a couple of minutes on each side until golden
dust the strawberries with caster sugar and grill them really quickly, just until the sugar on the outside browns
top the warm bread with ricotta and the grilled strawberries
 drizzle with honey and decorate with lemon zest
the first time i ever made this was at the neal street restaurant, and about two years later, when i was at the river café, rose gray showed me her way of doing it
 she inspired me to think of grilling as a really exciting way to prepare vegetables
wash all your vegetables
 heat the barbecue or a griddle pan, put your whole peppers on it, and get them really black on all sides
 while still hot, put them in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool
slice your courgettes lengthways about 0 point five  centimetres thick and do the same with your fennel, reserving the herby tops
 grill the courgette and fennel together on the griddle pan for about a minute on each side or until nicely charred
 you don’t want them too black or too raw
 transfer to a clean tea towel in one layer, making sure they don’t sit on top of each other, otherwise they will steam and go soggy
cut the aubergine across into slices one centimetre inch thick
 every now and again you get an aubergine that is really seedy — if this happens, it will be bitter and no good, so throw it away and get yourself another one
 chargrill the aubergine slices, turning them 4 times until nicely marked, then transfer to the tea towel
boil the baby leeks in salted water until they’re just cooked
 then drain, rub with a little olive oil, and chargrill them quickly until lightly marked
 peel the peppers but don’t hold them under the tap as all the sweet fantastic flavour will go down the drain
 carefully rub off the black skin, then remove the stalk and pips and tear the peppers up into large strips
 now put all the vegetables into a large bowl
take about a quarter of your basil leaves and bash them in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of seasoning until you have a smooth pulp
 add about 8 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the vinegar, to taste
 pour this over the vegetables and toss quickly so that everything gets coated in the lovely basil oil, then throw in the remaining whole basil leaves
 slice the garlic really thinly to give you a delicate flavour and add to the bowl with the fennel tops
 mix everything together, and serve on a large plate at room temperature
 great with any grilled fish or meat, or as part of an antipasti plate with some toasted bruschetta and some fresh buffalo mozzarella
this is a deliciously indulgent veggie side that's super quick to get in the oven and absolutely brilliant served with just about any meat or white fish, like cod or haddock
 preheat your oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 place the potatoes, celeriac and onion in an earthenware-type baking dish
 season generously
 add the garlic, ¾ of the cheese, the cream and the parsley stalks
 with a spoon, move everything around to mix all the flavours
 sprinkle over the extra cheese, and bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes, or until tender and golden
 sprinkle over the parsley leaves
i like to leave the gratin in the dish, pop it in the middle of the table and tuck in!wash the thyme stalks in hot water for 20 seconds
 when cool enough to handle, strip the leaves off the stalk
 in a food processor, whiz the thyme leaves, the cumin seeds and orange zest together with the butter
 lay out a 30 centimetres square piece of greaseproof paper on a work surface and scoop the butter on to the middle
 roll one edge up over the butter as if you were trying to fold the paper in half, and with your hands shape the butter into a cylinder shape as best you can
 wrap the butter up in the paper, twist the ends so the package looks like a christmas cracker and place in the fridge to set
steam the carrots for 10 minutes and, once cooked, toss in a warm bowl with some slices of the thyme, cumin and orange butter
first of all, slice the carrots or cut them up into fine ribbons, matchsticks or batons
 put them into a salad bowl with the coriander leaves and the sesame or poppy seeds
 to make the dressing, finely grate the zest of the orange into a bowl
 add the orange juice, the juice of 1 lemon and about 4 times that amount of extra virgin olive oil
 pound your toasted sesame seeds to a pulp in a pestle and mortar, then add to the dressing
 mix well, then season to taste with salt, pepper and possibly more lemon juice to make it nice and zingy so that you can taste it once you've dressed the salad
 once the salad is dressed, the flavour of the lemon will lessen, so get eating straight away
place the peppers directly onto a naked gas flame or under a very hot grill and let them blacken and blister
 turn now and then with a pair of metal kitchen tongs
 when blackened all over, pop them into a bowl and cover with clingfilm
 leave the peppers to steam for about 10 minutes, then remove the clingfilm and leave them to cool
 when they are cool enough to handle, rub off the blackened skin and brush away the seeds from the inside
 tear the mozzarella balls into chunks and divide between 4 plates
 tear the peppers into strips and divide over the plates of mozzarella
 halve the tomatoes and scatter over the top
 season well with sea salt and black pepper and drizzle with olive oil
 pick and tear up the basil leaves and sprinkle them over the salad before serving
preheat the oven to 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit or gas 4
peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves, finely slicing the stalks
prick the cherry tomatoes and place in a roasting tray, scatter over one of the sliced garlic cloves and a quarter of the basil leaves
 drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper, toss to coat, then roast for 20 minutes to intensify the flavour
meanwhile, heat a lug of oil in a large pan, add the remaining garlic and the basil stalks and fry for 1 minute, or until softened
 tip in the tinned tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon, then add 1 tin's worth of water
 bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes
tear in the bread up, mix well and season to taste
 tear in most of the remaining basil leaves and let the soup sit on a low heat for 10 minutes
 by this time the roasted tomatoes will be done, with juice bursting out of their skins, so add them to the pan, remembering to scrape all the lovely juices and sticky bits from the bottom of the tray
 give the soup a good stir – you're looking to achieve a thick, silky, porridgey texture, so feel free to adjust it with a little water, if needed
 remove from the heat, add 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and divide between your bowls
 serve with the remaining basil torn over the top
preheat the oven to 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit or gas 4
peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves, finely slicing the stalks
prick the cherry tomatoes and place in a roasting tray, scatter over one of the sliced garlic cloves and a quarter of the basil leaves

 give the soup a good stir – you're looking to achieve a thick, silky, porridgey texture, so feel free to adjust it with a little water, if needed
 remove from the heat, add 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and divide between your bowls
 serve with the remaining basil torn over the top
slowly heat the butter and a good lug of olive oil in a pan
 add the flour and stir around, then slowly pour in the stock
 turn up the heat and add the spring onions, peas and lettuce with a pinch of salt and pepper
 put the lid on and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender
 taste, correct the seasoning and squeeze in a little lemon juice
 serve drizzled with a splash of good oil
 it’s fantastic served with a piece of fish
half fill a large pot with salted water, bring to the boil and add your silverbeet and chicory
 cook for 2 or 3 minutes until the greens are tender, or al dente, then drain in a colander
 to your empty pan add 4 large lugs of olive oil and the garlic
 fry the garlic until lightly coloured, then throw in your cooked chicory and silverbeet
 season and stir around to coat in all the lovely flavoured oil
 after 1 minute, remove from the heat, add the rocket and squeeze in the lemon juice
 stir once more, check the seasoning again, and serve immediately
 great with grilled meats or scallops, or even served cold on an antipasti plate
squeeze the lemon juice into a clean jam jar
 add three times the amount of extra virgin olive oil, season with salt and pepper, then screw the lid on and shake to emulsify
add the rocket, watercress, pea shoots, apples, beetroot and beetroot leaves, if you have them, to a large bowl
 drizzle over enough dressing to completely coat the ingredients, add the marjoram, toss again and serve
roughly slice the roasted fennel, pick and finely chop the basil, reserving a few baby leaves for garnish, and deseed and finely chop the chilli
place a griddle pan on a high heat and toast the bread
meanwhile, place the fennel in a bowl with the chopped basil leaves and most of the chilli
 squeeze in the lemon juice, add a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and a few shavings of parmesan, then toss everything together
 have a quick taste and add a bit more lemon juice, salt or pepper, if needed
when the bread is nice and charred, halve the unpeeled garlic clove and rub the cut side all over both sides
drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, then top with a small handful of the fennel mixture
 tear the mozzarella into quarters and place one on each bruschetta, then top with some thin shavings of parmesan, a few little sprinkles of chilli and the reserved basil
for the dough, pile the flours and 1 level teaspoon of sea salt onto a clean surface and make a well in the centre
add the yeast and sugar to 650 millimetres lukewarm water, mix together and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well
using a fork and a circular movement, slowly bring in the flour from the inner edge of the well and mix into the water
 continue to mix, bringing in all the flour – when the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball
knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough
 keep kneading for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough
place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size
for the sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks
heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on a medium-low heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper
leave the sauce to tick away for around 20 minutes, or until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon
 when the time’s up, taste, and season to perfection
to assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half
 wrap one half in clingfilm and freeze for another day
 with the remaining half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls
flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave to rest for about 15 minutes – this will make them easier to roll it thinly
dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about half a centimetre thick
tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top
 continue doing the same with the remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile them up
 cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge
when you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 250 celsius or 500 fahrenheit or gas 9
at this stage you can apply your topping: spread the tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges
 tear over the mozzarella and scatter with the remaining basil leaves
 drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and add a pinch of salt and pepper
 if you can, cook the pizzas on a piece of granite in your conventional oven – if not, cook them one by one on pieces of tin foil directly on the bars of the oven shelf, towards the bottom of the oven 
 if you're going to cook your pizzas on the bars of the oven, make sure they're not too big – otherwise they'll be difficult to manoeuvre
 cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until the pizzas are golden and crispy
here are some of my favourite topping ideas:mozzarella, anchovies, chilli, capers and parsleysmoked pancetta, mozzarella, fresh chilli and tomatoesegg, prosciutto, artichokes, olives, mozzarella, tomato sauce and basilgreen and red grapes, rosemary, pine nuts and ricottapotatoes, mozzarella, rosemary, thyme and tomatoesslow-roasted shredded pork with thyme, taleggio and lemon-dressed rocketstage 1: making a wellpile the flour on to a clean surface and make a large well in the centre
 pour half your water into the well, then add your yeast, sugar and salt and stir with a fork
stage 2: getting it togetherslowly, but confidently, bring in the flour from the inside of the well
 you don't want to break the walls of the well, or the water will go everywhere
  continue to bring the flour in to the centre until you get a stodgy, porridgey consistency – then add the remaining water
 continue to mix until it's stodgy again, then you can be more aggressive, bringing in all the flour, making the mix less sticky
 flour your hands and pat and push the dough together with all the remaining flour
 certain flours need a little more or less water, so feel free to adjust
 stage 3: kneading!this is where you get stuck in
 with a bit of elbow grease, simply push, fold, slap and roll the dough around, over and over, for 4 or 5 minutes until you have a silky and elastic dough
stage 4: first proveflour the top of your dough
 put it in a bowl, cover with cling film, and allow it to prove for about half an hour until doubled in size – ideally in a warm, moist, draught-free place
 this will improve the flavour and texture of your dough and it's always exciting to know that the old yeast has kicked into action
stage 5: second prove, flavouring and shapingonce the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out for 30 seconds by bashing it and squashing it
 you can now shape it or flavour it as required – folded, filled, tray-baked, whatever – and leave it to prove for a second time for 30 minutes to an hour until it has doubled in size once more
 this is the most important part, as the second prove will give it the air that finally ends up being cooked into your bread, giving you the really light, soft texture that we all love in fresh bread
 so remember – don't fiddle with it, just let it do its thing
stage 6: cooking your breadpreheat the oven to 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit or gas 4
 very gently place your bread dough on to a flour-dusted baking tray and into the preheated oven
  don't slam the door or you'll lose the air that you need
 bake for 25-30 minutes or until cooked and golden brown
 you can tell if it's cooked by tapping its bottom – if it sounds hollow it's done, if it doesn't then pop it back in for a little longer
 once cooked, place on a rack and allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes – fandabidozi
 feel free to freeze any leftover bread
mix everything together in a bowl and season to taste
preheat the oven to 200 celsius or 400 fahrenheit or gas 6
 rub each potato with a little olive oil, then place in a large baking dish
 bake for 1 hour, or until the potatoes are golden and tender
 set aside until cool enough to handle
 leave the oven on
cut the baked potatoes in half, then use a teaspoon to scoop out the middle into a bowl – leave a bit of potato around the edges so the baked potato keeps its shape
 mash the potato with a fork
 chop half the rocket, then add to the potato with the gorgonzola
 season with pepper 
 the gorgonzola will provide the salt
  and mix together
 spoon back into the potato skins
place the potato skins on a couple of baking trays and bake in the oven for 10 minutes, to warm through and melt the cheese
 transfer to a serving plate and top with the remaining rocket dressed with extra virgin olive oil
 add a little blob of chopped mustard fruit, if using
 serve while still warm
preheat the oven to 220 celsius or 425 fahrenheit or gas 7
 wash your potatoes and parboil until almost tender, then drain
 pick and bash the rosemary leaves
drizzle with just a little touch of oil and roll in a teaspoon of sea salt, a little freshly ground black pepper and the rosemary
 put the potatoes in a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 25 minutes until golden
 or, wrap them in tin-foil and throw them on the barbie for the same amount of time
start by preparing the artichokes: peel them back to their pale, light leaves, then halve them and remove the hairy chokes with a teaspoon
 place the prepped artichokes in a pan with just enough water to cover them
 add the unpeeled garlic cloves and a little squeeze of lemon juice and cook until the stalks are tender
 drain in a colander, then place the artichokes straight back into the empty pan with 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry for 4 minutes to get a bit of colour on them
 when they're slightly golden, remove from the heat, squeeze in a little lemon juice, pick, roughly chop and add the mint leaves, then season carefully to taste with sea salt and black pepper
 remove 4 artichoke halves from the pan and put to one side, then mash all the rest in the pan, using a fork to squash the garlic out of the skins 
 throw the skins away
 for the basic bruschette, cut the loaf in half, then slice it crossways, about one centimetre thick
 chargrill these slices on a barbecue or in a griddle pan until they are crisp on both sides, then lightly rub each piece a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic
 drizzle with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a tiny pinch of sea salt
 spread the mashed artichokes over the basic bruschette, tearing one of the reserved artichoke halves over the top of each
preheat a griddle pan or barbecue
trim and slice the aubergines one centimetre thick
 peel and finely chop the onion, and peel and finely slice the garlic
place a large pan on a medium heat with 2 or 3 lugs of olive oil, add the onion, garlic and dried oregano, then cook for 10 minutes, or until the onion is soft and the garlic has a tiny bit of colour
 if you’re using tinned tomatoes, break them up, and if you’re using fresh tomatoes 
 which will obviously taste sweeter and more delicious, if they’re in season
 , very quickly prick each one and put them into a big pan of boiling water for 40 seconds
 remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and put them into a bowl of cold water for 30 seconds, then remove the skins, carefully squeeze out the pips and cut up the flesh
 add the tomato flesh or tinned tomatoes to the onion pan, give the mixture a good stir, then put a lid on and simmer slowly for 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced
 grill the aubergines on both sides until lightly charred – you'll need to work in batches
season the tomato sauce carefully with sea salt, black pepper and a tiny swig of wine vinegar, then pick in the basil
 you can leave the sauce chunky or you can purée it
spoon a layer of tomato sauce into a 15 centimetres by 25 centimetres baking dish, then add a fine scattering of parmesan, followed by a single layer of aubergines
 repeat these layers until you’ve used all the ingredients up, finishing with a little sauce and another good sprinkling of parmesan
 pick and finely chop the oregano, then toss with the breadcrumbs and a little olive oil, then sprinkle on top of the parmesan
 tear over the mozzarella 
 if using
bake at 190 celsius or 375 fahrenheit or gas 5 for 30 minutes, or until golden, crisp and bubbly – it’s best eaten straight away, but it can also be served cold
heat a griddle pan until nice and hot
 lay your aubergine slices on it side by side and when they are nicely charred on both sides, put them into a bowl
 you will probably need to do this in several batches
 while the aubergines are grilling, put 8 tablespoons of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of vinegar, with the parsley, mint and garlic, into another bowl and season with salt and pepper
 when the aubergines are all done, add them to the dressing and mix around, then check the seasoning again and divide on to the bruschetta
 press the topping into the toast so all the lovely flavour gets sucked in!peel the artichokes back to their pale, light leaves, then halve them and remove the hairy chokes with a teaspoon
 immerse the artichokes in water with half the lemon juice, with a heavy lid or heat-resistant dish placed on top of them to keep them immersed and stop them discolouring
start your risotto bianco and when you begin stage 3, drop 6 of your prepared artichoke halves into the simmering stock
 continue cooking the risotto, adding the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is half-cooked
 slice the remaining artichoke halves very finely and stir into the risotto
 continue stirring the stock into the rice
 at stage 4, when the rice is cooked and you have added the butter and parmesan, stir in the rest of the lemon juice
 take the pan off the heat and check the seasoning
pick and tear up the mint leaves
 remove the cooked artichokes from the stock pan and toss with most of the lemon zest, the torn-up mint leaves and a splash of olive oil
 spoon the risotto onto 4 plates and place the dressed artichokes on top
 drizzle with any remaining dressing from the bowl and serve sprinkled with extra parmesan and the rest of the lemon zest
first make your basic risotto recipe, then put a large saucepan on a medium to high heat and pour in half the stock, followed by all your risotto base
 stirring all the time, gently bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer until almost all the stock has been absorbed
 add the rest of the stock a ladleful at a time until the rice is cooked
 you might not need all your stock
 be careful not to overcook the rice – check it throughout cooking to make sure it’s a pleasure to eat
 it should hold its shape but be soft, creamy and oozy
 and the overall texture should be slightly looser than you think you want it
turn off the heat, beat in your butter, parmesan, gorgonzola, goat’s cheese, chopped apple and marjoram
 check the seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed
 put a lid on the pan and leave the risotto to rest for a minute so the cheese can really ooze into it
 while you’re waiting, gently heat the walnuts in a pan
 then either take the risotto to the table and let everyone help themselves, or divide it between individual serving plates
 put a block of parmesan on the table for grating over
 sprinkle with the walnuts and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil before tucking in
heat a griddle pan until it’s really smoking hot, then griddle each slice of ciabatta for a couple of minutes on each side until they are nicely charred
 cut the garlic clove in half, rub each ciabatta slice with garlic and drizzle with a little olive oil
 tear the mozzarella evenly over the 8 crostini
 season well with salt and pepper, sprinkle over the sliced chilli and basil leaves and grate over the lemon zest
 finish with another drizzle of olive oil
smash up the garlic with 1 teaspoon of salt in a pestle and mortar 
 or use the end of a rolling pin in a metal bowl
 place the egg yolk and mustard in a bowl and whisk together, then start to add your oils bit by bit
 once you’ve blended in a quarter of the oil, you can start to add the rest in larger amounts
  when the mixture thickens, add lemon juice
 when all the oil has gone in, add the garlic and any extra flavours 
 see above
 to finish off, season to taste with salt, pepper and a bit more lemon juice, if needed
try this: lemon -or basil- flavoured aioli is good with salads, all types of fish, and in seafood soups
 it's also great with roasted fish, chicken or pork, and is a classic with salmon
peel and finely slice the garlic
get a large pan of salted water on the boil
 melt the butter in a large ovenproof saucepan over a low heat, then add the flour and turn the heat up to medium, stirring all the time, until you get a paste – this is your roux
 add all the sliced garlic – don’t worry about the amount because each slice will caramelise like toffee in the roux
 keep cooking and stirring until golden and the garlic is nice and sticky
 add the bay leaves and slowly whisk in the milk a little at a time to ensure you get a nice smooth sauce
 bring the mixture to the boil, then leave it on a low heat to simmer and tick away, stirring occasionally
 preheat your oven to 220 celsius or 425 fahrenheit or gas 7
add the pasta to the pan of boiling salted water and cook according to the packet instructions
 meanwhile, roughly chop the tomatoes on a board and season them well with sea salt and black pepper
 grate the cheddar and parmesan
drain the pasta and add it immediately to the sauce
 give it a good stir and take the pan off the heat
 stir in your grated cheeses, chopped tomatoes and pick in half of the thyme leaves
 a little worcestershire sauce added now is nice, and so is a little grating or two of nutmeg
 now work on the flavour – taste it and season it until it’s hitting the right spot
 you want it to be slightly too wet because it will thicken up again in the oven, so add a splash of water if needed
if you’ve made your sauce in an ovenproof casserole-type pan, leave everything in there; if not, transfer it to a deep earthenware dish
 bake it for 30 minutes in the oven, until golden, bubbling, crispy and delicious
while it’s cooking, put your breadcrumbs and the rest of the the thyme leaves into a pan with a few drizzles of olive oil over a medium heat
 stir and toss the crumbs around until crunchy and golden all over
 remove from the heat and tip into a nice bowl
 serve your macaroni cheese in the centre of the table, with your bowl of crispy breadcrumbs for sprinkling over, and a lovely green salad
heat the stock
 peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, trim and finely chop the celery
 finely grate the parmesan
in a separate pan, heat the oil and 1 small knob of butter over a low heat, add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured
 add the rice and turn up the heat – the rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it
 after 1 minute it will look slightly translucent
 add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring — it will smell fantastic
 any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence
once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of sea salt
 turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn’t cook too quickly on the outside
 keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and almost massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next
 this will take around 15 minutes
 taste the rice — is it cooked? carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite
 don’t forget to check the seasoning carefully
 if you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water
remove the pan from the heat, add 1 knob of butter and the parmesan, then stir well
 place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes – this is the most important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes outrageously creamy and oozy like it should be
 eat it as soon as possible, while the risotto retains its beautiful texture
place the flour on a board or in a bowl
 make a well in the centre and crack the eggs into it
 beat the eggs with a fork until smooth
using the tips of your fingers, mix the eggs with the flour, incorporating a little at a time, until everything is combined
 knead the pieces of dough together – with a bit of work and some love and attention they’ll all bind together to give you one big, smooth lump of dough!  you can also make your dough in a food processor if you’ve got one
 just bung everything in, whiz until the flour looks like breadcrumbs, then tip the mixture on to your work surface and bring the dough together into one lump, using your hands
once you’ve made your dough you need to knead and work it with your hands to develop the gluten in the flour, otherwise your pasta will be flabby and soft when you cook it, instead of springy and al dente
 there’s no secret to kneading
 you just have to bash the dough about a bit with your hands, squashing it into the table, reshaping it, pulling it, stretching it, squashing it again
 it’s quite hard work, and after a few minutes it’s easy to see why the average italian grandmother has arms like frank bruno! you’ll know when to stop – it’s when your pasta starts to feel smooth and silky instead of rough and floury
then all you need to do is wrap it in cling film and put it in the fridge to rest for at least half an hour before you use it
 make sure the cling film covers it well or it will dry out and go crusty round the edges 
 this will give you crusty lumps through your pasta when you roll it out, and nobody likes crusty lumps!
how to roll your pasta:first of all, if you haven't got a pasta machine it's not the end of the world! all the mammas i met while travelling round italy rolled pasta with their trusty rolling pins and they wouldn't even consider having a pasta machine in the house! when it comes to rolling, the main problem you'll have is getting the pasta thin enough to work with
 it's quite difficult to get a big lump of dough rolled out in one piece, and you need a very long rolling pin to do the job properly
 the way around this is to roll lots of small pieces of pasta rather than a few big ones
 you'll be rolling your pasta into a more circular shape than the long rectangular shapes you'll get from a machine, but use your head and you'll be all right!if using a machine to roll your pasta, make sure it's clamped firmly to a clean work surface before you start 
 use the longest available work surface you have
 if your surface is cluttered with bits of paper, the kettle, the bread bin, the kids' homework and stuff like that, shift all this out of the way for the time being
 it won't take a minute, and starting with a clear space to work in will make things much easier, i promise
dust your work surface with some flour, take a lump of pasta dough the size of a large orange and press it out flat with your fingertips
 set the pasta machine at its widest setting - and roll the lump of pasta dough through it
 lightly dust the pasta with flour if it sticks at all
click the machine down a setting and roll the pasta dough through again
 fold the pasta in half, click the pasta machine back up to the widest setting and roll the dough through again
 repeat this process five or six times
 it might seem like you're getting nowhere, but in fact you're working the dough, and once you've folded it and fed it through the rollers a few times, you'll feel the difference
 it'll be smooth as silk and this means you're making wicked pasta!now it's time to roll the dough out properly, working it through all the settings on the machine, from the widest down to around the narrowest
 lightly dust both sides of the pasta with a little flour every time you run it through
when you've got down to the narrowest setting, to give yourself a tidy sheet of pasta, fold the pasta in half lengthways, then in half again, then in half again once more until you've got a square-ish piece of dough
 turn it 90 degrees and feed it through the machine at the widest setting
 as you roll it down through the settings for the last time, you should end up with a lovely rectangular silky sheet of dough with straight sides - just like a real pro! if your dough is a little cracked at the edges, fold it in half just once, click the machine back two settings and feed it through again
 that should sort things out
whether you're rolling by hand or by machine you'll need to know when to stop
 if you're making pasta like tagliatelle, lasagne or stracchi you'll need to roll the pasta down to between the thickness of a beer mat and a playing card; if you're making a stuffed pasta like ravioli or tortellini, you'll need to roll it down slightly thinner or to the point where you can clearly see your hand or lines of newsprint through it
 once you've rolled your pasta the way you want it, you need to shape or cut it straight away
 pasta dries much quicker than you think, so whatever recipe you're doing, don't leave it more than a minute or two before cutting or shaping it
 you can lay over a damp clean tea towel which will stop it from drying
start by making a temper
 peel the garlic, then finely slice with the chillies, ideally one millimetre thick on a mandolin 
 use the guard!
pour 2 tablespoons of oil into a large wide pan on a medium heat and add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves for 1 minute, then the garlic and chillies
 stir so everything’s flat, moving regularly until crisp and lightly golden
 with a slotted spoon, remove half the temper to a plate, taking the pan off the heat
peel the onions and ginger and finely chop with the coriander stalks, then chop the squash into 2 centimetres cubes, leaving the skin on but discarding any seeds
 stir it all into the pan and return to a medium heat for 15 minutes to soften
 stir in the lentils, then 1 point five  litres of boiling water
 bring to the boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cover for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally
mash the squash into the daal, taste and season to perfection
 remove 6 portions, bag them up and, once completely cool, freeze for a rainy day when you’ll be really grateful it’s there, leaving the rest on a low heat to keep warm
 blitz the coriander leaves, yoghurt, a pinch of sea salt and half the lime juice in a blender until smooth, then decant into a small bowl
 reheat the reserved temper in a non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat with 1 teaspoon of oil, then divide into two piles and crack an egg over each
 cover and leave to slowly fry on the bottom for 2 or 3 minutes, while they coddle on top
 one-by-one, puff up your dry poppadoms in the microwave for around 30 seconds each
 top each portion of daal with a fried egg, and pop some spinach, dressing, poppadoms and a lime wedge on the side
first make the chutney
 squeeze the lime juice into a food processor and blitz with all of the other chutney ingredients 
 removing the chilli stalk
  until smooth, adding a little water to loosen if needs be
 pour the chutney into a small bowl and chill in the fridge while you make your fritters
place the gram flour, spices and mango powder in a large bowl and whisk in 150 millimetres to 180 millimetres of cold water until it forms a thin batter
cut the aubergines into 3 millimetres rounds
in a deep saucepan, pour in sunflower oil to a depth of at least 2 point five  centimetres and bring it to 180ºc over a medium heat – test this with a thermometer, or drop in a cube of bread and when it bubbles immediately the oil is ready
using metal tongs, dip each aubergine slice in the batter, shake off the excess, then slide it into the hot oil
 do this in batches and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp
carefully remove from the oil and leave to drain on kitchen paper, seasoning with sea salt while still hot
drop the curry leaves into the oil and fry for 30 seconds, or until crisp 
 be careful as the oil will spit
 serve the fritters with the crispy curry leaves on top, a squeeze of fresh lime, and the coriander chutney on the side
