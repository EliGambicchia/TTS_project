Creation of a TTS voice tailored to the culinary domain of Italian recipes.

From the Abstract of the paper:

Unit-selection synthesis generates speech from the concatenation of smaller units. In this paper, we outline the different stages and potentially problematic aspects of building a unit-selection voice. Unit-selection synthesis relies heavily on its database for two factors: unit coverage and content of the speech data. Based on a phonetically-balanced script (CMU Arctic-A), we designed a new script – equally “rich” – tailored to the culinary domain of Italian recipes. We experimented the effects of i) content and ii) amount of the training data, using two test-sets containing recipe-related sentences and others of a more general nature. A MUSHRA listening test with native and non-native speakers of English showed that voices built with culinary-domain training data were scored significantly higher than voices built with out-of- domain data (p<0.05) when synthesizing recipe-related sentences. Additionally, our results suggested that a non-native speaker who has been regularly exposed to the language can be as reliable a listener as a native speaker.
